 - Better description of the attenuation: List of length by step of 10 cm along the wire
   for the irradiated zone.
 - Corrected the reclected component, proper attenuation now.

! 2012-12-07 - Olivier Callot
 - Multi-parameter attenuation along the fibre in MCFTDepositCreator
   * Short and Long attenuation length, with their fraction.
   * Zone affected by radiation: Losange defined by xmax and ymax
   * Attenuation length at centre of this zone
   * Refelxion coefficient of the mirror
   * Cut of in reflexion due to time delay, smoothly between y min and max.
   The map of attenuation in the fibre is computed at initialization, and then
   used by interpolation for each deposit

 - Manual implementation of the poisson generation of number of photo electrons,
   to avoid re-initializing the generator for each deposit. Factor ~10 in speed.
   Use a gaussian distribution for average > 50.
