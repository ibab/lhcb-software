</PRE><H1><A NAME=v36r5>2015-03-16 DaVinci v36r5</A></H1><PRE>

Development release for 2015 data taking, based on Gaudi v26r1,
LHCb v38r5, Lbcom v16r4, Rec v17r5, Phys v19r5, Analysis v13r4
and Stripping v9r5. Uses LCG_74root6 with ROOT 6.02.05.

- Refer to the release notes of Phys, Analysis and Stripping for details
  on updates to these dependency projects.

- Packages updated :
  DaVinciTests v2r30, Phys/DaVinci v36r5, Phys/KaliCalo v4r17, Phys/Tesla v1r3.

- Packages added :
  Major new version v5r0 of Event/EventPacker added only for this release,
  to solve seg faults observed when reading Strip21 MC.

- In DaVinciTests v2r30 :
  . Various reference files updated, notably those related to tagging and stripping.

- In Phys/DaVinci v36r5 :
  . Fixed PFN specified in DaVinci-Simplest.py so that file actually runs.
  . Removed trivial and obsolete option file DaVinci-MC09.py,
    and also DC06_v4_BB_lumi2_rdst.py.

- In Phys/KaliCalo v4r17 :
  . Package responsible updated.

- In Phys/Tesla v1r3 :
  . TES objects moved down one level, now under /Event/Turbo/HLTLINE/OBJECT
   .ROOT compression factor of LZMA:6 added.
  . Tesla created objects are now packed.
  . Containers are only written when created.
  . PV selection harmonised with offline.
  . PVs now the same for all resurrections in each event.

- In Event/EventPacker v5r0 :
  . Add protection to StandardPacker to prevent segmentation faults from a NULL
    pointer dereference in the case of corrupted reference information, due
    to truncation when attempting to pack it to a 32 bit int. Fixes issues
    seen when running over Stripping21 MC samples where some Track references
    in packed ProtoParticles have been corrupted due to data truncation. In
    these cases the smart refs are now just skipped (so set to NULL).
  . Update the packing of all remaining classes that still use 32 bit reference
    packing to use 64 bit packing. Reading is backwards compatible with old data
    using the packing data version flags. Consequently data written with this
    update can only be read by this version.
  . Implement 64 bit reference packing for MCParticle, MCVertex and TwoProngVertex classes.
  . Add a warning message to reference32 to warn if any code is still creating
    potentially problematic 32 bit packed references. Method is retained for
    backwards compatibility.
  . Add checks for remaining calls to hintAndKey64 for corrupt references
    (should be impossible for 64 bit packing).
  . Fix typo in MuonPIDPacker where version 2 was not declared as a known
    packing version in MuonPIDPacker::unpack.

Executive Summary of notable Phys, Analysis and Stripping changes 
( See project release notes for full details ) :-

Core DaVinci :-
 . Add a check to DVCommonBase to test for duplication in the Input particle
   locations. If duplicates are found, a warning is printed and the
   duplication is removed. 

FlavourTagging :-
 . Commit a new tagger: SSpion BDT.

TisTosTobbing :-
 . Update Hlt1TriggerTis, Hlt2TriggerTisTos to work with split Hlt1,

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v30r2>2012-04-02 DaVinci v30r2</A></H1><PRE>
This version uses projects LCG 62b, Gaudi v23r2, LHCb v34r2, Lbcom v12r2,
 Rec v13r2, Phys v14r2, Analysis v8r2 and SQLDDDB v7r*, ParamFiles v8r*,

Production version for initial 2012 data taking

For full details, see the release notes for Phys v13r2, Analysis v8r2 and 
Stripping v4r2. Also, see the reconstruction related changes in Brunel v42r2

Executive Summary :-

- External dependencies changes
 . Uses LCGCMT v62b. Relevant changes are ROOT 5.32.02 and neurobayes 3.7.0

- Loki Improvements
 . Add functor to BeamLineFunctions to calculate the DOCA to the beamline,
   using LoKi::FastVertex
 . Add functors related to the Velo hit pattern:
   TrNVELOSPACEPOINTS, TrNCONSECVELOSPACEPOINTS
    Evaluating the number of (consecutive) R and Phi hits in the same station,
    for the Hlt1 displaced vertex line:
   TrNVELOOVERLAPS, TrNVELOOVERLAPSR, TrNVELOOVERLAPSPHI
    Evaluating the number of A/C overlap hits, resp. after an OR of R and Phi,
    R only and Phi only, for the Hlt2 beam halo express stream line.

- Swimming 
 . Re-enable output algorithms before exiting to allow correct finalisation.
 . Fix XML summary writing.
 . Disable FSRInputCopyStreamWriter when swimming the trigger
 . Change the setting of "EnableUnpack" to be compliant with the new software stack.
 . Open shelve database read only.

- DecayTreeTuple 
 . TupleToolSwimmingInfo: replace "/" with "_" in decision branch names.
 . Fix some warnings about unsigned long usage.
 . Some fixes for running on uDSTs, in TupleToolTrigger and TupleToolStripping.
 . If HltRoutingBits are missing, catch the exception that is thrown in 
   TupleToolTrigger, so the processing does not terminate.
 . TupleToolTISTOS : Added Hlt1Phys Hlt2Phys

- Stripping (u)DST Content fixes
 . Add support for the packed track clusters on uDST streams. 
   Needed for Track refitting. 
 . Improve the ProtoParticle cloning to allow for dynamic checking of each
   ProtoParticle, and dependant data objects, to determine if they should be
   cloned or not for the stream in question. If the object resides in a TES
   location known to be completely copied to the stream output (for instance
   the standard reconstruction locations on DSTs) then it is not copied and
   the reference to that original container is kept. Otherwise, the objects
   are fully cloned.
   Fixes the problem on Calibration (and EW) DST streams that create custom 
   Tracks, ProtoParticles that where not being properly handled.
 . Fix the packing of RichPID and MuonPID objects, where the key was not
   properly restored.

Patch for https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?92524

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v30r1p1>2012-03-07 DaVinci v30r1p1</A></H1><PRE>

New development release, containing fully support for the new fully packed 
stripping (u)DSTs.

In Phys/DaVinci :-
 - If Simulation=True or DataType="MC09", force IgnoreDQFlags=True, to work 
   around an issue in LHCbApp. To be removed in a future release, when fixed 
   in LHCb.
 - Add the option "IgnoreDQFlags", which controls whether how DaVinci should 
   handle data DQ flags. Default is False, which means only data with good
   DQ will be processed.
 - Add the option "DQFLAGStag" for the DQ flags tag.
 - Add a "ProductionType" setting, that enables whatever options are needed
   in a given production (e.g. Stripping). Default is "None", no special 
   options.
 - Update the EnableUnpack property of the DaVinci configurable to accept a
   list of options, instead of just True or False. valid options are
   "Reconstruction" and/or "Stripping", to enable the unpacking of the 
   related data objects.

  * Based on LHCb v31r4 software stack.
  * Many, many MicroDST enhancements.
  * New DaVinci().EventPreFilters slot: takes list of algorithms that filter
    on DST (or MicroDST) data *before* anything else is run. This can save 
    *a lot* of time when analysing e.g. one or two lines in DSTs with many
    lines. Example:

    from PhysConf.Filters import Filters 

    fltrs = Filters  (
    HLT_CODE = "HLTPASS_RE('Hlt.*(MicroBias|Hadron).*Decision')" , STRIP_CODE = 'HLT_PASS_RE('StrippingStripD2K(K|P)P_(A|B)_LoosePID_.*Decision')" , 
VOID_CODE = " EXISTS('/Event/Strip') & EXISTS('/Event/Charm')" 
                     ) 

    DaVinci ( 
             ...
             EventPreFilters = fltr.filters('MyFilters')
             ...
             )

    This will apply HLT and Stripping dec report requirements, plus filter on 
    the existence of '/Event/Strip' and '/Event/Charm' before anything else 
    is cone.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v21r0>2008-11-28 DaVinci v21r0</A></H1><PRE>
Based on Phys v7r3, Analysis v2r3, Rec v6r0, HLT v4r4, Lbcom v6r24, LHCb v26r0, Gaudi v20r3, LCGCMT 55b

Highlights

 * DaVinci
  - New DaVinci configurable, basic examples in options/Davinci-Default.py and options/DaVinci-2008.py
    Working QM test example tests/options/DVTestB2DiMuon.py

 * Phys/DaVinciTools
   - IOnOfflineTool/OnOfflineTool
    . Interface now only returns strings with names of PV location or some 
      tools, depenting on context. It no longer holds any tools of its own.

   - Related or "best"PV finding overhaul
   . New IRelatedPVFinder interface. No configuration beyond that of GaudiTool. All configuration at compile-time, through template GenericParticle2PVRelator with implementations (typedefs) for on and off-line, IP and IP Chi2

   - PhysDesktop
    . Output location no longer fixed to "Phys/AlgName". Now taken from IOnOffline::trunkOnTES() method. Default" "Hlt/AlgName" and "Phys/AlgName" for on and off-line respectively.
    . Input locations now deduced from context if AlgName not preceded by a "/":
      "MyBsSelection" becomes "Phys/MyBsSelection" or "Hlt/MyBsSelection" in off/online context
      "Phys/MyBsSelection" stays the same regardless of context.

    . Desktop now uses new IOnOfflineTool and it's own IRelatedPVFinder.
      Defaults for IRelatedPVFinder and IDistanceCalculator are now "".
      In this case, IOnOfflineTool is in charge of getting the type name
      of the implementation of these two. A similar logic applies to the 
      location of primary vertices.
    . Add property P2PVInputLocations, vector of strings with TES locations of
      Particle* -> VertexBase* relations. The PhysDesktop now can take 
      user-defined P->PV relations tables. These over-write relations loaded
      from the default location InputLocations + "/Particle2Vertices".
    . When dealing with Particles and PVs, users should now use the relations
      and not the primaryVertices() method directly.

 * Ex/MicroDSTExample:
   - Improvements to MicroDST making python script, addition of python helper modules to aid in reading of DST and MicroDST, improvement to MicroDST reading script.

        Following my presentation of today, it had been agreed to put this
        modification of the xSlope of trgforward tracks into the next release

Main modifications:
 
  - MuonID:
    . New tuning for DC04 (E.Polycarpo). See Erica's talk at 
      http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a055058#2005-12-08 
      WARNING: This new tuning is used by default, affecting all
      Muon identification. To switch it off edit DaVinciReco.opts.

  - Background categorisation tool:
    . First partial implementation of the Background categorisation tool
      DaVinciMCTools/IBackgroundCategory (V.Gligorov). See Vava's talk at
      http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a055152#2005-12-16

      of a Particle (PK).

  - DVAlgorithm: New methods globalFitter() and descendants() returning 
      pointers to IGlobalFitter (G.Balbi) and IParticleDescendants (PK).
       Requires recompilation of all private code.

  - TriggerSource
    . New package that gets the TisTosTob information witout using the Tampering.
        Works for L1, HltGeneric and HLT (PK). See Patrick's talk at
	http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a057167#2005-12-05
    . L1Score: Added some additional temporary fields to store all L1 triggering 
        tracks (PK).

        Only D* slection is used by default.
	New optional steams: inclusive Phi (M.Patel) and inclsuive dilepton (PK)
    . HltScore: New vector of HltAlgorithmScore inclusiveCandidates() that 
        behaves as the exclusive counterpart and contains all inclusive candidates. 
        By default only contains HLTFilterDstar (PK).
    . HltSelections : Adapt to new structure (PK).
        New tuning of all selections (L.Fernandez).
    . HltSelChecker : Adapted to new structure. Added TestHltScore and 
        PlotTrackDeviation from the HltMonitor package (RTTC). With this move
	HltSelChecker becomes RTTC-incompatible (PK).
    . TrgPrimVertex : Redesigned PV finding (M.Witek). See Mariusz's talk
        at http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a057168#2005-12-12

   . Bug fixed in the momentum error parametrization  
   . Added the facility to create Particles by smearing the MCtruth information of only stable products of a given decay Channel 
     Different options are possible:
      1) smearing according a Gaussian or Double Gaussian distribution
      2) adding BIAS to the measurement and/or ScalingFactors covariance matrix 
         (momentum dependent parametrization  C0+C1*p ..see below) 
      3) generate correlated or NOT measurements
      4) smear MCTruth information at its origin Vertex or at PointOnTrack

      OnlyStableDecayProducts (Default:false) to generate Particles only from the stable products 
                                              of the decay channel. If true also  OnlyDecayProducts must be set true
      SmearATPoT (Default:false) if true smears the MCParticle info at PointOnTrack
                                 (minimum distance from beam line) otherwise it smears at origin vertex 
      rhoVAR1VAR2(Default=0.0) set the correlation coefficient between VAR1&VAR2 (VAR== x,y,tx,ty,p)

!========================== ParticleMaker v1r6p1 2005-12-15 ===================
! 2005-11-11 - P. Koppenburg for G. Balbi
  - src/ParticleStuffer.h
    . Issue a warning when there is not particle property found
    . Convert to GaudiTool

!========================== PVEff v1r0p1 2005-10-21 ===================

  - src/TamperingL1Alg.cpp
    . Bug fix: Do not ignore Elec and Phot triggers
  - xml/TamperingResults_Event.xml
    . Added HLT results
! 2005-10-31 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/Tampering.opts
    . Include options from L1 rather than copying them
!========================== TriggerSource v1r0 2005-12-15 ===================
! 2005-12-09 - Patrick KOPPENBURG
 - New package TriggerSource that allows to get TisTosTob for
   for L1, HltGen and Hlt without running the Tampering.
   It works by matching online to offline tracks.
   See talk at 5/12/2005 T-Rec
   http://agenda.cern.ch/askArchive.php?base=agenda&categ=a057167&id=a057167s1t3/transparencies

   It contains:

   - TriggerSource/ITriggerSource.h
     . Interface that returs a TisTosTob enum for a given input (B) particle

   - src/L1TriggerSource.{cpp,h}
   - src/HltGenericTriggerSource.{cpp,h}
   - src/HltTriggerSource.{cpp,h}
     . Three concrete implementations for L1, HltGeneric and Hlt.
     . Presently Photons are not matched, hence it will not get correct
       results if the signal particle contains photons (all photons
       are considered as non-signal)
     . It is recommended to use these tools directly from one's monitoring
       (ntuple filling) algorithm.

   - src/TriggerSourceAlg.{cpp,h}
     . Algorithm that allows to run the three tools on the final particles
       in the input location. It saves the output in a TamperingResult object.
       Only one object per event is saved, hence only the first candidates 
       considered.

   - src/TriggerSourceMonitor.{cpp,h}
     . Algorithm that compares the Tampering and TriggerSource results for L1.
     
   - src/TriggerSourceBase.{cpp,h}
     . Shared implementation class for the three tools. Do not use.
     
   - options/DVTriggerSource.opts
     . Example option file to run the two abovementioned algorithms
     
   - options/DVMonitor.opts
     . Run in monitor mode, i.e. without a B candidate. Reserved for experts

      "There is a bug in the TrParabolic extrapolator. Since the DaVinci 
       transporter is a copy of this the bug also exists there.
       The bug has little or no effect for long tracks (maybe there are some 
       subtle effects if you look in detail). For seed or VeloTT tracks it can 
       have more effect. ie I cannot tell you whether you need to urgently fix it 
       or not.
       The problem is that the field is taken to be constant and equal to that 
       at the start of the extrapolation. This is wrong. Better is to integrate 
       the field along the trajectory. In practice I get similar results to 
       integrating  by taking the field at the midpoint of the extrapolation. ie 
       in the TrParabolicExtrapolator (similar in the ParabolicTransporter)"

!========================== Bu2JpsiK v1r0 2005-10-19 ===================
! 2005-10-18 - P. Koppenburg
  New package containing a selection for B+ -> J/psi K+. Requested by O. Leroy
  for tagging studies.
  The cuts have been copied from Bu2LLK (B+ -> l+l-K+) but adding a J/psi mass
  cut and remiving all IP/PV separation cuts. 
  The package only contains a DC04 selection and no preselection. Use
  the J/psi preselection in PhysSel/Jpsi instead.
  There is only a genric selection selection both the ee and mumu modes. Experience
  with Bu2LLK shows that the efficiencies of each selection on the other signal 
  sample is very low.
  
  Files:
  - options/DVDC04selBu2JpsiK.opts

!========================== L1Reco v6r2 2005-10-19 ===================
! 2005-09-30 - P. Koppenburg for Sandra Amato
 - L1Match2dMuonHits and L1Match3dMuonHits
   . Check that L0Muon has found the events.
  
! 2005-09-23 - P. Koppenburg for Sandra Amato
 - Added new algorithms L1Match2dMuonHits and L1Match3dMuonHits
   . L1Match2dMuonHits.cpp:
     Try to do the match between 2d velo tacks and muon segments
     reconstructed using the muon hits in M2-M5.
     The algorithm is executed only in case there has been at least one match
     with L0MuonCandidate.
     Reconstruct all the muon segments.
     For a given 2d velo track, loop over the muon segments. Take the y
     position of its M2 hit, extrapolate to the z of the velo track and check
     if it is inside the corresponding velo sector. In case this is true,
     calculate the x as x**2+y**2 = R**2. Estimate the slope in x as xVelo /
     (trackZ - zpv) where zpv is given by zpv =z - r/slr. 
     Extrapolate the x position of velo 2d to the center of magnet,
     extrapolate the muon segment to the same z, and choose the muon segment
     with the smallest difference in the extrapolation. Apply some cut to
     this difference depending on the region. Having passed the cut, the 2d
     is selected as muon candidate.

   . L1Match3dMuonHits:
     Try to do the match between 3d velo tacks and muon segments
     reconstructed using the muon hits in M2-M5.
     The algorithm is executed only in case there has been at least one match
     with L0MuonCandidate.
     Reconstruct all the muon segments. Use only the ones that have not been
     matched previously as L0MuonCandidate.
     For a given 3d velo track, loop over the muon segments.
     Extrapolate the x velo track to the center of magnet, and x muon segment
     to the same z.
     Extrapolate the y velo track to M2.
     Take the muon segment with the smallest Delta y and Delta x, and apply
     cuts on these distances, depending on the region.
     If several velo tracks are matched to the same muon segment, take only
     the two with smallest Delta y.
     Assign a momentum to the velo track.

!========================== TrgSys v1r10 2005-10-19 ===================
! 2005-10-18 - P. Koppenburg
  - Remove TrgMuonID. All its functionality is taken over by TrgMuon
    run in the HltGeneric sequence.
  
! 2005-09-23 - P. Koppenburg for Sandra Amoto
  - New muon matching
  
! 2005-09-02 - P. Koppenburg for Mariusz Witek
  - New TrgTools
  - Added TrgVertex2Container to TrgChecking sequence

!========================== TrgTools v6r5 2005-10-19 ===================
! 2005-10-18 - P.Koppenburg for V. Gligorov
 - TrgTools/ITrgTrack2TrStoredTrack.h
   . New method doubleMatched().
 - src/TrgTrack2TrStoredTrack.{h,cpp}
   
! 2005-09-30 - P.Koppenburg for V. Gligorov
 - src/TrgTrack2TrStoredTrack.{h,cpp}
 - TrgTools/ITrgTrack2TrStoredTrack.h
   . New tool that associates TrgTracks to TrStoredTracks
   
! 2005-09-02 - P.Koppenburg for Mariusz Witek
 - src/TrgVertexToContainer
   . Algorithm allowing to look at L1 and HLT vertices in TES instead of 
     those in dedicated trigger.
!========================== TrgMuon v1r3 2005-10-15 ===================
! 2005-10-15 - Alessia Satta
 - Main modification:  
   a standalone algorithm for muon reconstruction for trigger has been 
   created (named TrgMuonRec)
   This algo can be used by Hlt and L1 muonID setting the appropriate 
   output container where the muon segments are stored.
   The muon identification of velo tracks is performed in the HltMuonRec 
   which uses the utput of TrgMuonRec in input.
   Additional improvement: the decoding of the muon buffer has been optimized
	 in speed. 
   Some better tuning of the reconstruction cuts has been implemented.
   To use this new version a different HltGeneric sequence should be used
   an example is reported here:
   HLTGenericSeq.Members =  {
     "TrgMuonRec"
    ,"HltMuonRec"
    ,"HltGenericSelection"
    ,"DecodeTTFromRaw/GenMakeTTHit"
    ,"TrgVeloTT/GenVeloTT"
    ,"TrgMuonRecover"
    ,"FwdHitFromRawBuffer/GenMakeTHit"
    ,"TrgForwardAlg/GenForward"
    ,"TrgMuonRefine"
    ,"TrgInsertTrackErrParam/GenErrParam"
    ,"TrgParticleMaker/GenParticleMaker"
    ,"HltGenericDecision"
  };
  where the explicit call to HltMuonRec has been added.

Main modifications:
 
 - L0 and L1 Triggers: New options for high luminosity samples. Simply add
          #include "$L0DUROOT/options/L0-lumi3e32.opts"
          #include "$L1DECISIONROOT/options/L1-lumi3e32.opts"
     or
          #include "$L0DUROOT/options/L0-lumi5e32.opts"
          #include "$L1DECISIONROOT/options/L1-lumi5e32.opts"
     to your options.

     and http://tschieti.home.cern.ch/tschieti/lhcb/L1/highLumi.html
 
 - L1 retuned. No cut on number of PVs anymore. Warning: different results 
      than from DC04v2 stripping to be expected.
     
 - HLT: HltGeneric is always run. The explicit inclusion of  
     $HLTGENERICROOT/options/HltGeneric.opts is not necessary anymore. Just do:
          // Run HLT generic and HLT selections
          #include "$HLTSELECTIONSROOT/options/HLTSelections.opts"
       TrgParticleMaker now knows how to make protons and Bremsstrahlung-
       corrected electrons.
 
 - PhysDesktop: New method that returns the primary vertex as PrimVertex.
     Usage:
     std::vector<const PrimVertex*> primaries = desktop()->primaryVertices<PrimVertex>() ;
 
 - Kernel/IJetMaker.h
     Jet finding tools. See DaVinciKernel release.notes.
 
 - New CheckSelResultsTool (ICheckSelResults) that checks for SelResults.
   See Tools/Utilities release.notes

 - Memory leaks fixes in Tampering and BTagging

 - The stripping scripts have been rewritten.

! 2005-07-14 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - redesign of the package
   1) remove the ugly functionality from the tool.
      Now tool is just a super-light class, teh actual 
      work is delegated to the algorithm (and Data-On-Demand service)
   2) Add the algorithm to build the relation tables 
 
  "Typical" usage is 

     #include "Relations/IRelation2D.h"
     #incldue "MCTools/HepMC2MC.h"

     typedef IRelation2D<HepMC::GenParticle*,MCParticle> Table ;
  
     const Table* table = get<Table>( HepMC2MCLocation::Default ) ;

     const HepMC::GenParticle* genp = ... ;
  
     // get the corresponding MCparticle(s) 
     Table::Range  mcps = table->relations( gen ) ; 
     // loop over related particles:
     for ( Table::Range::iterator mc = mcps.begin() ;  
      mcps.end() != mc ; ++mc ) 
      {
        const MCParticle* mcps = mc->to() ;
      }
  
  In principle number of rleations is either 0 or 1 (by construction), therefore 
  the loop coudl be substituted:
  
   const MCParticle* mcp = 0 ;  
   if ( !mc.empty() ) { mcp = mc.front().to() ;}
 

  For inverse relations (get HepMC::Particle, related to a given MCparticle) :

   typedef Table::InverseType   ITable ;
   
   // use "inverted" itable:
   const ITable* itable = table->inverse() ;

   const MCParticle*  mcp = ... ;

   // get the corresponding HepMC::GenParticle(s) 
   ITable::Range  genps = itable->relations( gen ) ; 
   // loop over related particles:
   for ( ITable::Range::iterator gen = genps.begin() ;  
      genps.end() != gen ; ++gen ) 
      {
        const HepMC::GenParticle* genp = get->to() ;
      } 
  
   // OR: 

   const HepMC::GenParticle* genp = 0 ;  
   if ( !genps.empty() ) { genp = genps.front().to() ;}


   To use these functionality, incldue the following lines into your *.opts file: 

      #include "$LOKIGENOPTS/HepMC2MC.opts"

!========================== Utilities v2r1 2005-08-23 ===================
! 2005-07-25 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - src/CheckSelResultsTool.cpp
   new tool which implements abstract interface ICheckSelResults, 
   which allows to check the "selection results". It is especuially 
   convinient 
   to inspect the results of stripping or sto study the correlations 
   correlations between "(TDR,HLT,"Pre")-selection" and 
   "preselection" or different (pre)-selections

   Usage:
   ======
   
   // locate the tool:
   const ICheckSelResults* check = 
    tool<ICheckSelResults> ( "CheckSelResultsTool" ) ;
   
   // use it e.g in filling of N-Tuple:
   tuple -> column ( "mumu" , check -> isSelected ( "PreselBs2MuMu" ) ) ;
         tuple -> column ( "hh"   , check -> isSelected ( "PreselB2hh"    ) ) ;
   
    Selections and flags are either specified exlicitely throught 
    the arguments of the  2nd and 3rd form of "isSelected" method, 
    or specified through the properties of the tool (for the first 
    form of "isSelected" method. In this case:
    
   
    <XXX>.CheckSelResultsTool.Selections = { "PreselBs2MuMu" , 
                                             "PreselB2hh"    } ;
    <XXX>.CheckSelResultsTool.ANDmode    = false               ; // default
    <XXX>.CheckSelResultsTool.Prefix     = "/Event/Phys/"      ; // default

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r12>2005-07-06 DaVinci v12r12 - Updated DC04 version</A></H1><PRE>
New version based on LHCb v16r5
use XmlDDDB v22r2 version used during DC04

Main modifications:
  FlavourTagging
    The tagging is now a tool again (IBTaggingTool), that calls
    ITagger tools. It returns a FlavourTag that contains all
    necessary information (Marco Musy)
    The BTagging is still working, but now only calls the tool.
    Have a look at Marco's slides at the 07/07 Tagging WG meeting:
    http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a053447#2005-07-07    
    The BTagging is still working, but now only calls the tool.
    New package FlavourTaggingChecker with all MC-truth stuff.
  DaVinciKernel: 
    DVAlgorithm now provides a method flavourTagging() 
    interfacing the new tagging tool.
  DaVinciFilter: 
    All FilterCriteria now have a "flagging" mode where the cut is not 
    applied but saved in a FilterCriterionResult
    object on the TES. Allows to recover correlations of cuts.
    Technicalities: New base-class FilterCriterionBase that all
    FilterCriteria now implement. (Cristina Lazzeroni)
  HLT & DaVinciTools: 
    Changes for RTTC (PK & Luis Fernandez)
    Now the PV location and the geometry tools are obtained from
    an OnOffline tool.
  LoKi: v3r13p1

   the tagger candidates to BTaggingTool which eventually combines them
   into a final decision
 - SecondaryVertexTool has been splitted into 3 separate tools all
   inheriting from the same interface ISecondaryVertexTool which has been
   modified to return a vector of vertices instead of a single vertex
   A new SVertexABTool is created. It returns two vertices instead of 
   just one, for the moment only for development purposes.

!========================= LoKi v3r13p1 2005-06-16 ==================
! 2005-06-02 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - LoKi/LoopObj.h
   src/LoopObj.cpp

  New method for changing the particle ID for "loop"-object is introduced
   
  for ( Loop Bc = loop ( "psi pi" , "B_c+" ) ; Bc ; ++Bc ) 
   {
     // set particle ID according to the charge of the pion
      Bc->setPID ( Q( Bc(2) ) > 0 ? "B_c+" : "B_c-" ) ; 
      //
      Bc->save("Bc") ;
   }

  IMPORTANT:
  ==========
  The treatment of setPID method is modified now.
  The particle ID of existing effective particle will 
  be modified (if proper ownership is establshed).
  For some configurations (rare) it could result in 
  deletion and recreation of existing particle object. 
  In this case, the results of various fit procedures 
  could be modified. Therefore *IT IS RECOMMENDED* to 
  use this method *ONLY BEFORE* the  actual explicit 
  constrains procedures, e.g.
  
  correct order: 

      Bc->setPID( ... ) ; 
      Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime) ;  

  "wrong" order: 

     Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime ) ;  
     Bc->setPID( ... ) ;       

   It could be wrong e.g. in the context:

      for ( Bc = loop ("psi pi", "B+") ;  .... ) 
        {
            Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime ) ;  // WRONG
            Bc->setPID( "B_c+") ;                      // WRONG  
            Bc->save("Bc") ;       
        } 
   Here for the saved object only Vertex-constrained fit is performed.
   (Note the mismatch between "B+" and "B_c+") 


   Many thanks to Andreas Wenger for use-cases....

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r8>2005-03-03 DaVinci v12r8 - Parralel version with v13r0</A></H1><PRE>
Version released in parralel with v13r0 containing a lot of trivial
fixes to accomodate CLHEP 1.9 (used in v13r0, not in this version).

The L1 memory leak has been fixed

But there is still a memory leak in L0Muon. To avoid this, L0Muon
is not run anymore in L0.opts. !WARNING! This will make you use the old
obsolete muon trigger result stored on the DST. So either you get the old L0Muon
or you live with a 20kB memory leak. 

There are some changes in Physics tools:

- The ICheckOverlap tool has been completely revised. It now accepts 
  const inputs. The missing single-particle method has been added. 
  Another new method removeOverlap( ParticleVector& ) removes particles
  with overlap (i.e. typically a B where twice the same track has been used)
  for the vector.
  
- A new OverlapFilterCriterion applies the CheckOverlap tool in a filter.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r7>2005-02-14 DaVinci v12r7 - Hlt development version</A></H1><PRE>
Backward-compatible HLT development version. Based on Gaudi v15r3 with patched 
GaudiPoolDb and LHCb v16r4. Includes LoKi v3r9.

Main Modifications:

    *  On popular demand the PhysDesktop now provides two methods
               const VertexVector& primaryVertices();     // get all PVs
               const VertexVector& secondaryVertices();   // get vertices from InputLocations
            The method
               const VertexVector& vertices();
            is now slower as it uses the above methods, but still exists.
       
    * Updated L1Decision. WARNING: This version gets significantly different
      results from the official stripping version in DV v12r4.
    * Updated flavour tagging, now using the tampering by default.
    * Complete HLT update. Still for experts only.
    * Many modifications in LoKi.
    * Many small changes to prepare for migration to CLHEP 1.9. See details.

!========================== FlavourTagging v5r4 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-02-02 - P. Koppenburg for Marco Musy

  - options/CheatedSelection.opts
    . Removed DaVinciCommon and DaVinciReco already included in 
      DVBTagging.opts

! 2005-01-31 - P. Koppenburg for Marco Musy
Main changes/upgrades are the following:

- tagging efficiencies and performance calculation are now moved
to BTaggingMonitor so that no truth information is accessed at any stage.

- BTagging.cpp still needs to rerun the trigger because it 
makes use of the tampering info

- SecondaryVertex is now a tool, and the user can choose whether
to use the TDR definition or the revised version of it using
NeuralNets (default is old tdr)

- I implemented the new definition of tagging categories, obtained
by using a NNet tuned for each taggers separately. 
these NNets are accessed via a tool (this was asked for in a meeting).
the user can still choose to stick to the old TDR categories via 
BTagging.CombinationTechnique = "TDR";

- summaryof.cpp is an additional standalone program to quickly get 
useful numbers out of the logfiles. it contains the instructions on
how to run it.

- DVBTagging.opts is meant as an example option file. 

!========================== ParticleMaker v1r3 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-02-09 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/PhotonFromMergedParameters.h
 - src/PhotonParameters.h
   . CLHEP 1.9 does not allow to forward declare classes in a backward 
     compatible way.
 
!========================== PhysSelections v6r12 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-02-14 - P. Koppenburg

  - src/KFFitTool.cpp
  - src/KFFitTool.h
  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
  - src/LifetimeFitter.h
  - src/TrgDispCalculator.cpp
    . Adapt to the plain stupid new structure of CLHEP 1.9, ensuring
      backward compatibility (hence no forward declarations). One cannot
      mix Vectors and Points in formulae anymore. One cannot easily convert
      one to the others. :-(
    . Make them GaudiTools where not already done.
    . Fix a few compilation warnings.

! 2005-02-08 - P. Koppenburg for Hugo Ruiz
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . New version that accepts intermediate states. Works fine with
      short-lived resonances but not yet well with long-lived like D0.
  - src/TrgDispCalculator.{cpp,h}
    . New tool that performs the job of the GeomDispCalculator
      and uses the sames assumptions as the TRgVertexFitter. Gets identical
      results under these assumptions.
  
! 2005-02-04 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/TrgVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Fast Unconstrained Vertex Fitter by Hugo Ruiz.
      Works only with Particles made from TrgTracks. Assumes cylindrical 
      errors around the trajectory.
  - src/VertexFitter_load.cpp
    . Use it.
  - src/UnconstVertexFitter.{cpp,h}
    . Make it a little more readable

!========================== TrgCalo v1r0p2 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r6>2005-01-19 DaVinci v12r6 - Hlt development version</A></H1><PRE>

  Major Modifications:
  --------------------
  - CombinedParticleMaker:  Set ExclusiveSelection to false by default
     !!! WARNING !!! This is a major change that will change the result
                     of all selections using the CombinedParticleMaker without
		     resetting this options. In particular most stripping
		     preselections use ExclusiveSelection = true ; 

  - All Interfaces are moved from $DAVINCIKERNELROOT/DaVinciTools/
    to $DAVINCIKERNELROOT/Kernel/ for compatibility with LHCb.
    -> Replace all ``DaVinciTools/'' by ``Kernel/'' in all code.
    The DaVinciTools/ directory is still there as long as there is some code
    not yet adapted and contains dummy files including the proper file.
    
  - New doxygen style using dogygen 1.5. The main "feature" is that now
    classes taken from LHCb and Gaudi are linked to and not included.
    A disadvantage is that they do not appear in the alphabetical list
    anymore. If you want to look at the "GaudiTool" doc, either go to
    Gaudi under "See also:" or follow a link from any tool.
    
  More new features:
  ------------------
  - First full pre-release of the HLT
    . New version of HltGeneric
    . Use of TrgMuon that allows to skip TT for muons
    . First release of HltSelections
    . First release of HltSelChecker
    -> All this is for experts. Contact Patrick.Koppenburg@cern.ch
       if you need to run the HLT prototype.
    
  - On popular demand, the IParticleFilter now includes methods
    StatusCode filterByPID (const ParticleVector &, ParticleVector &, const std::string &, const bool alsoCC=true)=0
    StatusCode filterByPID (const ParticleVector &, ParticleVector &, const int &pid, const bool alsoCC=true)=0
    
      ParticleVector myKaons, myPiPlus, myPiMinus;
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myKaons,   "K+");
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiPlus,  "pi+", false);
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiMinus, "pi-", false);
    
    would return a vector of kaons (both sign) and pions.
    
  - New algorithm IsBEvent in DaVinciMCTools that easily allows to select 
    events containing a b quark in any sequencer. Actually works for
    any quark or particle(s)
  
  - New tool family "IPlotTool" with implementations SimplePlotTool and
    RecursivePlotTool. Make plots for a given Particle or ParticleVector.
    The plots have to be configured by options. The algorithm
    SimplePlots does nothing more than calling such tools:    
      HLTPlots.Members += { "SimplePlots/HLTB2HHPlots" };
      HLTB2HHPlots.PhysDesktop.InputLocations = { "Phys/HLTFilterB2HH" } ;
      HLTB2HHPlots.Plots.Variables = { "M", "Chi2", "Pt" } ;    
    plots the mass, chi2 and Pt of all particles in "Phys/HLTFilterB2HH"
    
  - Small changes in FlavourTagging. No need to run L1 anymore
  
  - The Tampering is released. Ask Mariusz Witek for help in you want to run it.
  
  - New preselections DsSelector and Bc2RhoPi
  
  - Few modification in LoKi

    . Relevant options
  - src/HltSelections_load.cpp
  - options/TrgTracks.opts
    . Modified accordingly

! 2005-01-12 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSharedD0.opts
  - options/HLTSharedKstar.opts
  - options/HLTSharedPhi.opts
    . Options for the shared basic resonances. 
      IMPORTANT: There is no D~0 in HLT. Every decay to h+h- with h=K,pi
      and a mass compatible with D0 is a D0. Never a D~0!
      Consequently D*- -> D0 pi- and D*+ -> D0 pi+!
      Same for B0->K*D0.
  - options/HLTselB2HH.opts
  - options/HLTselBd2D0Kstar.opts
  - options/HLTselBd2DstarPi.opts

  - options/HLTselDstar.opts
    . Refelect the new locations
  - options/HLTSelections.opts

  - src/MakeResonances.{cpp,h}
    . New option "DecayDescriptors", a vector of strings that *supercedes*
      the DecayDescriptor for the initialisation of the 
      DecodeSimpleDecayDescriptor tool. This allows the same algorithm to
      find several decays. 
      Example:
    HLTSharedD02HH.DecayDescriptors = { "D0 -> pi+ pi-", "D0 -> K+ pi-", "D0 -> pi+ K-", "D0 -> K+ K-" } ;

! 2005-01-11 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HltMuonHighway.opts
    . Upper mass in dimuons set to 14 TeV
    (tag as pk20050112)

! 2005-01-11 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSelections.opts
  - options/DVHLTExSelections.opts
    . Include HltGeneric.opts *after* Hlt.opts. This can also be done in
      DVHLTCorr.opts. Needs HltGeneric v2r1 and TrgSys v1r1p1
  
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSelections.opts
    . Add a sequencer HLTExclusive
    . Add an empty sequencer TrueSignals. It can be filled in HltSelChecker
  - options/HltselB*.opts
    . Add them to HLTExclusive sequence
    
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTselBd2DstarPi.opts
    . rename "HLTDstar2D0Pi" to "HLTDstarForBd2DstarPi"
  - options/HLTselBd2JpsiKs.opts
    . Removed. High-IP J/psis are in MuonHighway
  - src/MakeResonances.*
    . Use IPlotTools to make recursive plots.
      Example:
// D* stream
HLTselDstar.Members += {"MakeResonances/HLTFilterDstar"};
[...]
HLTFilterDstar.HistoProduce = true ;
HLTFilterDstar.DaughterPlots.Variables = { "M", "Chi2", "Pt", "IPs" } ;
HLTFilterDstar.MotherPlots.Variables =   { "M", "Chi2", "Pt", "IPs", "FS" } ;
HLTFilterDstar.DaughterPlotsPath = "DstarIn" ;
HLTFilterDstar.MotherPlotsPath   = "DstarOut";

! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTselB2HH.opts
  - options/HLTselB2MuMu.opts
    . Typo fix.
    
! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg for Guy Wilkinson
  - options/TrgTracks.opts
    . The copying of pi, K, mu, gamma should not be in the main HLT sequence 
      or hadronic channels would need a muon to be there to be found.
    
! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg
  # Complete rewriting of the options using the new MakeResonances and

      in this package forever.
    . Uses the ByPIDFilterCriterion to have the same syntax as 
      FilterDesktop (replacing RefineSelection), in Phys/DaVinciFilter
    . Allows to apply a mass window *before* the vertex cut that can 
      save orders of magnitude in CPU time for a three-body decay 
      for instance.
    . Allows to kill overlapping combination of particles (can be switched off
      by options)  
    . Practical Example:
         MakeResonances.PhysDesktop.InputLocations = {"Phys/PreLoadKaons", "Phys/PreLoadPions", "Phys/PreLoadProtons"};

         MakeResonances.DecayDescriptor = "[D_s- -> K+ K- pi-]cc";

         //                                           "pi+ : BooleanFilterCriterion"};
         MakeResonances.MotherFilter.Selections = {"D_s- : VtxFilterCriterion/DsFilter"};
         MakeResonances.Window = 50*MeV ;
         MakeResonances.KillOverlap = true ;
         MakeResonances.MotherFilter.DsFilter.MaxChi2 = 200 ; // some filtering

  - src/ChangePID.cpp
    . For composite particles, use the vertex of the first origin and not

      (affects only the chain CombinedParticles -> ChangeDecayChain -> ChangePID )
    
! 2004-09-07 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/ChangeDecayChain.cpp

        the daughters in ChangeDecayChainDaughter.
      - MotherLocation = "blabla" ;
      - DaughterLocation = "blablabla" ;
        Changes these locations to "blabla"
      - MoreReplacements: Allows to provide two replacements for the same decay 
        chain. For instance
        ChangeDecayChain.Particles = {"rho(770)0", "pi+", "pi-"};
        ChangeDecayChain.Replacements = {"K*(892)0", "K+", "pi-"};

! 2004-07-09 - P. Koppenburg
   - src/ChangePID.*
     . DVAlgorithm that copies a particle into
       another location and changes its PID. Works for single (from protoparticle)
       and composite particles (from vertex). In the former case 
       the energy is recalculated. Never apply this algorithm on particles
       created by a mass-constrained vertex fitter (obviously).

 - DaVinciTools/IParticleFilter.h
   . Added filterByPID methods
     These two methods allow to get a subset of particles
     with the same PID without having to use the PIDFilterCriterion
     -> The same instance of ParticleFilter can be used for all
      Particles.
      ParticleVector myKaons, myPiPlus, myPiMinus;
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myKaons,   "K+");
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiPlus,  "pi+", false);
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiMinus, "pi-", false);
      would return a vector of kaons (both sign) and pions.

Currently 3 functions are implemented:

  1) decayAngle    (which is a generalisation of 
                    LoKi::Particles::RestFrameAngle functor.
                   It allows to avalyate not only "decay" angle, but also
                   "helicity" angle (suitable for  
                     "0 -> ( 1 ->  0 + 0 ) + 0"  or 
                     "0 -> ( 1 -> 0 + 0 ) + gamma" decays )

  2) transversityAngle 
                    Evaluation of "transversity" angle, 
                    which is very useful to disantangle the states 
                    with different CP-parity for 
                     "0 -> ( 1 -> 1/2 + 1/2 ) + ( 1 -> 0 + 0 )"  decays 

  3) forwardBackwardAngle
                    Evaluation of angle, useful for estimatuon of 
                    forward backward asymmetry for 
                     "0 -> X + (1/2+1/2)" decays  


  For the first period, the file LoKi/Angles.h 
  is not included into the overall LoKi/LoKi.h, 
  therefore explicit '#include "LoKi/Angles.h"' is required.
      - to be fixed later
                     

  - LoKi/Extract.h
    new function to "Extract" the connet of the particle(s):
   
    getTrgTracks, trgTracks 
       these functions allow to extract all "TrgTracks" from the given Particle 
       of set of Particles 

    getOrigins, origins
       These functions allow to extarct all "origin" (==ContainedObject) form 
       the given particle or set of Particles.

       These function will be used to substiture the "overlap check" in the LoKi's loops
       (currently overlapping test is based on ProtoParticle content, 
        and therefore not applicable for Hlt particles. For next version
        it will be based on "origin" content and therefore 
        it wiull be applicable for Hlt particles as well)
        
  - cmt/requirements   version increment to v3r7

!========================== DaVinciAssociators v5r2p1 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-23 - P. Koppenburg
 - options/TestAssociators.opts
   . Renamed as DVTestAssociators.opts
! 2004-11-16 - P. Koppenburg

     "cannot find container /Trg/Long..."
!========================== DaVinciEff v3r2 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-25 - Peter Igo-Kemenes
 - src/EffSelCheck.{h,cpp}
   . Small bug correction for PhiPhi
   
! 2004-11-15 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - src/EffSelCheck.{h,cpp}
   . Restore the option SelDecay even if it is obsolete and ignored, to
     ensure some backward-compatibility with existing options.
   . Make it a GaudiAlgorithm, use err()...  and tool<>()...

! 2004-11-15 - Peter Igo-Kemenes
 - src/EffSelCheck.cpp
   . An error has been corrected: There was an unnecessary "break" statement 
     in a for-loop preventing one from considering ALL decays of interest 
     which were found in the selection. The break statement has been taken out.
   . The code has been modified: the selection efficiency is now correctly
     normalised in such cases where the decay of interest consists of idendical
     sub-heads (e.g. Bs->PhiPhi).
   . The range of the mass-histograms for sub-heads is now calculated
     automatically using the width information in the ParticleProperties. 
     The minimum range of the mass histograms is +- 100 MeV about the nominal 
     mass value; but in the case of broad resonances (e.g. a1) this is increased 
     to +- twice the "width" with width = ParticleProperty->maxWidth().

!========================== LoKi v3r6 2004-12-01 ===================
! 2004-11-26 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - LoKi/Selected.h 
    fix a bug/feature/typo   (Thanks to slc3 platform)

! 2004-11-25 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - src/MCMatchObj.cpp
    bug fix for TrgTrack -> MC matching 


! 2004-11-24 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - LoKi/Tuple.h, src/Tuple.cpp

    From now TrgDecision object could be put directly into NTuple with 1 line of code:
    
    const TrgDecision* trg = get<TrgDecision>( TrgDecisionLocation::Default );
    Tuple tuple = nTuple("My Analysis N-Tuple");
    tuple << TupleColumn("", trg ) ;
    tuple->write() ;

    Now this trick is available for
       EventHeader, L0DuReport, L1Score and TrgDecision  classes.
    e.g.

     const EventHeader* hdr = ... ; 
     const L0DUReport*  l0  = ... ; 
     const L1Score*     l1  = ... ; 
     const TrgDecison*  trg = ... ; 
  
     tuple << TupleColumn( "" , hdr ) 
           << TupleColumn( "" , l0  )
           << TupleColumn( "" , l1  )
           << TupleColumn( "" , trg ) ;

     tuple->write() ;

     It worth to emphasize here that "TupleColumn" is applicable 
     for *ALL* types of column, and in the case of 
      "no template specialization defined" the expresion
  
          tuple << TupleColumn( "name" , object ) ;

     is equivalent to the expression
   
          tuple->column( "name" , object ) ;


! 2004-11-22 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - few new features to modify the technical implementation of MC truth associations

     1) now LoKi is able to use MC truth accosiation for 
		     "basic" Particles, created from TrgTrack
     2) The "input" information is in a form of object 
        which implements the interface: IRelation<TrgTrack,MCParticle> 

     3) From now LoKi algorithm is able to read relation tables 
        directly from TES
        The list of tables used from MC relations is under the control 
        of new proeprties of classs LoKi::Algo

  NB:
      The tables used here need to be properly declared to 'Data-On-Demand' 
      service, or alternatitevy some "fine tutning" with job-options is required.
 

      For some time these properties with coexist with "associators" properties, 
      later the associators properties will be removed 
 
      For current default configuration, all "new" featured are disabled. 
      For the next step ( based on LHCB_v17r1 ) the interchange of 
      "direct tables" and "associators" will be performed.
      And later, the associators will be removed from LoKi.

   Substitute  Range_  -> NamedRange_ 

   From now all LoKi's ranegs are "Named" range.

   Through the goodies of templates and typedef *NO* user code 
   needs to be changed, (But everything *MUST* be recompiled)

   This new concept allows more control over loops ets..

    Range pions = select( "pi" , .... ) ;
   
    info() << " Range  name=" << pions.name() 
           <<        " size=" << pions.size() << endreq ;
  
  It is especially useful for "explicit loops" 
 
      Range pions = select( "pi" , ... ) ;
      Range kaons = select( "K"  , ... ) ;
    
     Loop D0 = loop( pions + kaons , "D0" );

   the TrgTrack. 0 = no vertex assigned...
!========================== TrgTools v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-11-12 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix the TrgParticleMaker: 
    - Option 'MakeNEutrals', default false
    - Produces electrons if any particle is tagges as such
    - the conversion was not done properly, only long tracks
      were made as particle in all cases...
    - Default is NOT to convert non-prolongated VeloTT.
 - Sort VeloCoord during the decoding (L1R, L1Phi, Raw) to insure
   that data are properly sorted. In principle done by the TELL1
   board and then by th efilling of the buffer, but just in case...

! 2004-11-05 - C Carloganu

   . Printout PV location on debug() mode
 
! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - TrgInitEvent doesn't clear the containers. This is taken care of by the 
   algorithms.
 - TrgVertices are converted in TrgParticleMaker, this was in TrgTrackToContainer

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - In TrgMCReconstructed, the container checked is now a jobOption.
 - L1InitEvent doesn't register L1Event in TES. L1Score is also not needed
   by the L1Processing sequence, just for monitoring.
 - TrgParticleMaker creates a TES container from the Long tracks, and the non
   prolongated Velo-TT. The name of these two containers are job options. 
   The second name can be empty. The key of the tracks from the second container
   are shifted by 10000.
!========================== TrgVelo v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Use the RSector and backward track method, instead of playing with type.

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - Detect if in L1 or HLT, to change the container names
 - Compute the average Velo charge in HLT context (VeloSpaceTracking)
   and store it in pidQuality.
 - In the space track fit, use a multiple scattering term constant with
   P, assumming all tracks have the same Pt.
!========================== TrgVeloTT v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-11-12 - Olivier Callot
 - New option 'NotUsed' (true) to ask that hits used (when only 3) are not
   used. This was the default. If false, we still ask at least one of the
   two half-TT station to be unused. Increases efficiency (.5%) and 
   ghosts (2%), no turned on by default.
 - New option finalMatchTolSlope, default 0, studies in progress.

! 2004-11-09 - Olivier Callot
 - Split TrgVeloTT in 3 algorithms, and an imporved tool
    DecodeTTFromRaw
    DecodeTTFromL1
    TrgTTHitHolder
   The first two are the decoding from Raw or L1 Buffer, and the TrgTTHitHolder
   has now the structure by TTPlane of the hits. This makes TrgVeloTT lighter
   and will allow to have different versions in an easier way.

! 2004-11-09 J.A. Hernando
  - TrgVeloTT: Posibility of selecting the input and output container 
	of tracks (when no the algorihtms is not named "L1")
    option: InputTracksName and OutputTracksName

! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Do not track backward tracks.

! 2004-10-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Introduce the protection and fix for the faulty TT coding in L1Buffer as
   reported by Matt in a mail today: Protect if data = -1, exchange 2<->1 for 
   cluster size and increase strip number if size is now 1.
 - Detect L1/HLT context from name, can be changed by option 'Level1'.
   Remove option InputFromRawBuffer.

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - Adapt to the new names of the containers, differing for L1 and HLT

! 2004-10-27 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - src/CaloTrackAlg.h, src/CaloTrackAlg.cpp
    the algorithm is modified to take advantage from 
    new class TrTrackUse from Calo/CaloUtils package 
 - src/CaloMergedPi0Alg.h, src/CaloMergedPi0Alg.cpp

    new property "EtCut" is added to skip the processing of 
    clusters with small transverse energy.
    The default value of this oproperty is -100*GeV
   (which implies "NO CUT", and "BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY" 
    in the sense of absolute reproducibility of results). 
    The idea comes from Olivier Deschamps and Cristina Carloganu.

    Another new property "MaxIterations" is added to reduce the 
    number of iterations 
    The default value (16) is "BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE"
    The idea comes from Olivier Deschamps and Cristina Carloganu.

    In addition few "tiny" modification are applied:
      - remove "count" loop 
      - location of spddigits and prs digits are moved from internal loop
        to a top level 

    The usage of EtCut=1.5*GeV and MaxIteration=6 togather with 
    these 'technical' optimizations  
    speeds up the execution of the algorithm approxmately 20 times.

 - introduce FAST "photon" matching of trigger track (TrgTrach) with 
   Calotrimeter clusters. For a moment follow "off-line" phylosophy:
   perfroam all-to-all mathcing and save result as a relation table 
   in TES. The supporting algorithm CaloCluster2TrgTrackAlg does this job.
   The execution is 5-6 times faster than the execution of 
   "standard" photon matching. The efficiency need to be testes 
   and studied.
   In real environment one coudl gain addiitonal factor of 2
   (since if one uses this "o nly" fo select neutral clusters - "photons")
   one does not need all-to-all matching (and one does not need to 
   register the table in TES!),  one just che the existence of

   2) modify the internal chi2 method to be more efficient 
      (eliminate the intermediate matrices) 
   3) introduce local matrix storage
   4) itoriducet mtrxOp methods for fast evaluation of matrix products 

       in overall (142) gives >10% impromevent in CPU performance 

   5) introduce new internal structure MatchStruct2 
   6) introduce set of new "chi2" methods dealing with MatchStruct2 
  
        (5) and (6) are the steps toward HLT matching

     The algorithm gas got 2 new properties 
   "Sort"     (boolean, default = true ) - the flag which indicates wether 
                                           the sorting of clusters should 
                                           be performed
   "SprtByET" (boolean, default = false) - the flag which indicates 
                                           which sorting criteria (energy 
                                           versus transverse energy) is used 
                                           for sorting

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r1>2004-09-16 DaVinci v12r1 - version with updated L1 and more HLT</A></H1><PRE>

 Identical to DaVinci v11r13 except:
      
 - Built on Gaudi v15r2 and LHCb v16r2
 
 - CaloDigitsFromRaw is now an "algorithm-on-demand"
 
 - New Trg Event model and updated L1 trigger
 
 - All DaVinci tools now run on particles made from trigger tracks for HLT.
   User selections can be adapted easily too:
   1) if you use the PV from VertexLocation::Primary, foresee the 
      possibility to get it from TrgVertexLocation::Velo3D in HLT mode
   2) Check always that the protoparticle is actually there
        PP = dynamic_cast<ProtoParticle*>((*iPart)->origin());
      might be NULL. In this case you can do
        TT = dynamic_cast<TrgTrack*>((*iPart)->origin());
      You will need to #include "Event/TrgTrack.h" for this.
   3) Replace DaVinciReco.opts by Hlt.opts and do not run any particle maker.
      You can decide if you want to make all particles both as pions and
      kaons (default), or only as kaons with
        TrgParticleMaker.MakeKaon = false ;
      Your particles will be in /Event/Phys/Trg
 
   This version uses the new CMT environment. The $CMTPATH points now to
   $HOME/cmtuser. Do not use $HOME/newmycmt anymore.

    I've put few modifications into Event/CaloEvent package 
    to provide the appropriate "loading-on-demand"  for 
    Calorimeter digits

    From now there is no nesessity to execute "CaloDigitsFromRaw" 
    algorithm at all.
    Algorithm itself is modified to produce only 1 
    containerner per instance (thus one need to have 4 
    instances for 4 calorimeters). The overall speed of 4 
    instances is improved by 20% by replacement of "sort" 
    with "stable_sort" algorithm and  with the proper 
    "reserve" manipulations.

    The corresponding instance will be invoked 
    automatically by nice Markus' service  "DataOnDemand".

    for new configuration one need to add the following
    lines into the "main"-options file (e.g. Brunel.opts):

    // add the service ito the list of external servcies 
    ApplicationMgr.ExtSvc += { "DataOnDemandSvc" } ;
    // enable "DataFault" incidents from Event Data Svc 
    EventDataSvc.EnableFaultHandler  = true ;

    The specific configuration is described into the file 
    $CALOEVENTOPTS/options/CaloEvent.opts 
    which needs to be included from the "main"-options file:

    #include "$CALOEVENTOPTS/options/CaloEvent.opts"

    Some changes are also needed in DaVinci options, namely

    - In L1Decision.opts replace algorithm L1Dimuon by L1Muon 
    - in Hlt.opts, add TrgMuonID in the DLLs, and in the after TrgForward 
      in the algorithm, 
    Remove TrgTrackToContainer. Add the options 
    TrgVeloTTHlt.AcceptInHole = true;  
    #include "$TRGMUONIDROOT/options/TrgMuonID.opts"
    - In L1Checking : remove the TrgTrackToConatiner.prefix option
    - in HltChecking, add the options
     HltTrgTrack2MCParticle.prefix = "Hlt/";
     HltTrgChecker.prefix          = "Hlt/";
    If not the monitoring of L1 and HLT can not be set together.

! 2004-09-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/Particle2MCLink.cpp
   . Temporary hack suggested by Olivier Callot that solved the TrgTrack association
     problem. Not a definitive solution as it involes the hard-codeing of the

  - src/SelResultCombinatorics.*
    . Algorithm that checks correlations of SelResult outputs. It prints
      a list or a table (default). Just give the list of algorithms:
         SelResultCorrelations.Algorithms = { "alg1", "alg2", ...  } ;
      This makes all the combinatorics of algorithms. One can also give
         SelResultCorrelations.AlgorithmsColumn = { "alg1", "alg2", ...  } ;
      which then provides the efficiencies of the "Algorithms" versus
      "AlgorithmsColumn". The same algorithm may be in both lists.
      (two identical lists are equivalent to an empty AlgorithmsColumn list).
         SelResultCorrelations.PrintTable = true ; // (default)
      switched between table and list printout. The latter is ugly but
      helpful if one wants to `grep' the output file.
  - options/DVSelResultCombinatorics.opts

   trimmed version of the offline Muon ID. The algorithm also includes a fast 
   decoding of the Raw Buffer, based on Muon/MuonDAQ package, and a building 
   of pads from strip based on Muon/MuonRec. Speed is the main concern here.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r0>2004-08-24 DaVinci v12r0 - first version with Gaudi v15</A></H1><PRE>

 Identical to DaVinci v11r13 except:
      
 - Built on Gaudi v15r1 and LHCb v16r1
 
 - #include" GaudiTools/..." -> #include" GaudiAlg/..." 
 
 - LoKi v3r4p1
 
 - DaVinciTools has been split into 6 packages 
   . Phys/DaVinciKernel : DVAlgorithm, PhysDesktop and all Interfaces
   . Phys/ParticleMaker : All particle makers and the ParticleStuffer
   . Phys/DaVinciFilter : All Filter
   . Phys/VertexFit : All vertex fitters and the GeomDispCalculator.cpp
   . Phys/DaVinciTransporter : All transporters
   . Phys/DaVinciTools : Basically all high-level tools that are none
        of the abvove, f.i. DecayFinder, PreDV, CheckOverlap...    
   This split became necessary since DaVinciTools was become a huge monster
   containing unrelated stuff (what do the TrackTypeFilterCriterion and the 
   CombinedParticleMaker have in common?). Also DaVinciTools was evolving
   with all versions of DaVinci. In the short term, I hope that most 
   developments will affect DaVinciFilter, while the other packages will
   be rather stable except for bug fixes.
  
 - Bug fix in L1Decision
 
   This version uses the new CMT environment. The $CMTPATH points now to
   $HOME/cmtuser. Do not use $HOME/newmycmt anymore.

================================================================================
Phys/DaVinci	 	v11r13	Committed
! 2004-08-17 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/L1Checking.opts, options/HltChecking.opts
    . Some minor changes to avoid a memory leak and allow to make particles
      with Trg tracks.  
================================================================================
Phys/DaVinciTools	 v10r2	Committed
! 2004-08-12 - P. Koppenburg
  Many modifications to allow DaVinciTools to work with particles made
  from TrgTracks for HLT:
  - cmt/requirements
    . Use TrgEvent
  - src/FlightDistanceFilterCriterion.*
  & src/Momentum2FlightAngleFilterCriterion.*
    . Use PV from Trg when UseTrgPV option is switched on (OFF by default)
  - src/PVIPFilterCriterion.*
    . Use PV from Trg when UseTrgPV option is switched on (OFF by default)
    . Use PV from Phys when UseOfflinePV option is switched on (OFF by default)
    . Determine which PV to use from track origin when nothing is switched on.
      This does not work as expected when composte particles made from Trg 
      particles are used. To be revised...
  - src/TrackTypeFilterCriterion.*
    . Works with Trg tracks, but assumes they are all Long.      
  Also a little cosmetics:
  - src/MassDifferenceFilterCriterion.*
  & src/MassFilterCriterion.*
  & src/PIDCriterion.*
  & src/PhysDesktop.*
    . Make it a GaudiTool. Use message service shortcuts.
  - src/PIDCriterion.*
    . Use CL = 0 when the list of confidence levels is not given. This
      makes sense for HLT and for composite particles where the CL is 1 anyway.
! 2004-08-04 - G. Raven
  - DaVinciTools/IDecodeSimpleDecayString.h
  - src/DecodeSimpleDecayString.{cpp,h}
    . Add a few 'const' were possible...
================================================================================
Phys/PhysSelections 	v6r9	Committed
! 2004-08-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/RefineSelection.h
   . Add option ExclusiveSelection, that allows to require that
     all particle that do *not* match the PID given in the list
     of ParticleNames are rejected. False bu default. 
! 2004-08-11 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/RefineSelection.h
   . Use pid, not abspid of particle. Note that to apply the same cuts on 
     D0 and D~0, one needs to say
     RefineSelection.ParticleNames = {"D0", D~0" };
     RefineSelection.FilterNames = {"D0Filter", D0Filter"} ;
! 2004-08-10 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/RefineSelection.cpp
   . More consistent ouputlevels.
   . Use message service shortcuts   
! 2004-08-04 G. Raven
  - src/CombineParticles
     . no need to have IDecodeSimpleDecayString as a member
     . Move some initialization from 'initialise' to the first time
       'analyse' is called as a workaround to a problem with the 
       ordering between the creation of a HybridFilterCriterion and
       Pool -- somehow loading the LoKiHybrid dictionary (which is done
       by the python code generated during the initialization of a Hybrid
       FilterCriterion) causes a POOL not to initialize its own 
       dictionary. By reordering things such that POOL already started
       reading when the LoKiHybrid dictionary is loaded this problem
       goes away. NOTE: this is a workaround, not the final solution!

   . Reorder cuts to minimize CPU time consumption (first all 4-momentum cuts,
     then vertexing)
   . Quit loop as soon as one B candidate has been found.
     NOTE: This is OK for stripping, but not for signal analysis where 
     association with truth might be useful. An option that switches this 
     on/off should be added.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v11r12>2004-08-03 DaVinci v11r12 - DC'04 tests version</A></H1><PRE>

 - Intermediate steps towards v12r0. New syntaxes required by the new CVS/Gaudi
   are used whenever already possible.
   
 - Event/L1Event is obsolete and removed. Corrected all instances
   under Phys/ and commented them out under PhysSel/.
   
 - TEMPORARY PATCH:
      Because of a bug in MinimalEventLoopMgr.cpp,
      an algorithm contained in two sequencers
      is executed twice. This is the case of 
      CaloDigitsFromRaw when both the Electrons

      To avoid the problem, execute the algorithm
      in DaVinciCommon.opts, hence in *all* events.

Phys/DaVinciTools	v10r0	Committed
! 2004-07-22 - P. Koppenburg for Yuehong Xie
 - src/NsctVeloTransporter.cpp
 - src/TrTransporter.cpp
   . Problem found with impact parameter of a gamma converting to two electrons. 
     The problem was that I forgot to set the error of z to zero after all the 
     other elements of the error matrix are transform to a state with err_z=0. 
     It didn't cause any problem to vertex fitting, which doesn't use the error 
     of z at all, but led to failure in calculating impact parameter, for which 
     the error of z is used.

   . In NsctVeloTransporter.cpp I fixed two other problems:
     o checked charge of particles before adding multiple scattering error
     o for multiple scattering, added 3 missed correlation elements in the 
       error matrices. 
 
! 2004-07-20 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/LagrangeMassVertexFitter.cpp
   . Bug affecting only Windows
      -> put definitions
         Particle* part3 = pList[2];
         Particle* part4 = pList[3];
     in the sections where one knows that there are more than 2 particles.

  - src/FlightDistanceFilterCriterion.{h.cpp}
    Shorter options. see below.
  
! 2004-07-16 - P. Koppenburg for Yuehong Xie
  - src/LifetimeFitter.cpp
    . posMomCorr() was misused as the upper square in LifetimeFitter.cpp, 
      and this is fixed.
  - src/LinearTransporter.cpp
    . A transfromation is introduced in  LinearTransporter.cpp to account 
      for the z uncertainty of the initial state. It changes nothing when 
      the initial state is not from a fitted vertex and thus has no error 
      on z.
      The code for the linear transport of the covariance is also rewritten 
      to make it short and to fix the problem of two missing lines in the 
      old version
        newPosSlopesCorr(1,2) = oldPosSlopesCorr(1,2) + dz*oldSlopesMomErr(1,2);
        newPosSlopesCorr(2,1) = oldPosSlopesCorr(2,1) + dz*oldSlopesMomErr(2,1);
      This is not a complete fix to the initial covariance matrix problem.
      There are two things to be solved:
      *) charged particles like D+, Ds+
      *) if one use CombinedTransporter which uses extrapolators in the 
         Tr/TrExtrapolator package. 

! 2004-07-16 - P. Koppenburg for Luis Fernandez
  - src/FlightDistanceFilterCriterion.{h.cpp} (preliminary version)
    . Returns a yes/no depending on flight distance / significance w.r.t either 
       -> all PVs (for the min cuts)
       -> Best PV, chosen as the one for which the IPS of the composite 
          particle is the smallest (for the min and max cuts)
       Cuts:
        - on the minimum signed or unsigned flight distance or significance
          w.r.t all PVs or the Best PV
        - on the maximum signed or unsigned flight distance or significance

  - I have retuned the jpsi2ee preselection in order to get a rejection factor

    up the Pt cut and add a cut on the impact parameter significance of
    electrons with respect to primary vertices.

    signal efficiency on B_s0 -> J/psi phi, and without sacrificing
    too much J/psi sideband...

 - Algorithm L0Check performs a series of checks on the L0 performance
   and prints out a summary table.
   Tool L0CandidateMCTool accesses Monte Carlo information relative to the 
   L0 calorimeter and muon candidates.

 - Use XmlDDDB v20r1 and ParamFiles v3r1

 - Necessary options for reading POOL files are always on in DaVinciCommon.opts
   To read a Pool file it is enough to define its type in 
   EventSelector.Input. An example is provided in DaVinciTestData.opts that
   reads a Brunel v23r1 file written with Pool.

 - Remove explicit use of CaloInterfaces and CaloUtils packages, also 
   removed from project, since they are now part of LHCb v15r1.
   The same applies to MCTools. 

 - Use new version of PhysSelSys v6r2 that includes new version of LoKi v1r10
   with changes for Python

 - Adapt the DaVinciTest pacakge options to follow removal and introduction

   types of ProtoParticles and PrimaryVertices. 

 - Define DaVinci alias in requirement file to point to optimized executable
   Options can be passed as argument.

 Bug fixes:
 . Fix bug in TrTrasporter fix bug in the construction of the covariance
   matrix passed to the extrapolator. The bug involved the momentum row
   so any mass constrained fit using the TrExtrapolator could not work

 TDR data can be read but not all features are supported beside decay channel
 selections. See details for DaVinci v10r0.

 - Version based on Gaudi v14r0 and LHCb v15r0

 - Integrate reading POOL files. For the moment the default is GaudiDb 
   files. Pool files can be switched on uncommenting specific lines in
   DaVinciCommon.opts to load the necessary dll and services.
   The GaudiDb persistency is set up via new $STDOPTS/RootDb.opts

 - To read a Pool file it is also necessary to specify the file type 
   in the EventSelector.Input. An example of how to do it is provided in 
   DaVinciTestData.opts. A file catalogue where the file is
   listed also need to be provided.  
   By default DaVinciTestData.opts reads Brunel v23r0 file written with
   GaudiDb. 

 - Adapt DstContent.opts to what written by Brunel v23r0

 Known problems: 
 . ChargedProtoP are not made using TTT tracks when reading a Pool input
   file. The problem is in fact that in optimized mode HepVector in 
   TrState{P,L} is not correctly loaded.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v10r0>2004-02-05 DaVinci v10r0 - Development Version</A></H1><PRE>

 This version is mostly for developement and the main focus is for new data.
 TDR data can be read but not all features are supported beside decay channel
 selections. See details below.
  
 Note that the PhysSel packages DVxxx.opts have NOT been modified so will
 not run out of the box. Refer to the points below to modify them accordingly
 to run on TDR data or new data as needed.
  
 - Version based on Gaudi v13r0 and LHCb v14r0

   . Given changes in OTDet and OTChannelID, algorithm that access this
     information in the data will not work anymore for TRD data: this applies
     for example to the TrReconstructible tool and hence to the efficiency
     algorithm.

 - Modify DaVinci.opts to remove inclusion of not supported features for new
   data
 
 - Remove Hlt that will be replaced by new implementation in future versions
   and would not work on TRD data because of changes on OTChannelID respect
   to what in the TDR. Packages used for Hlt as well as Hlt.opts are 
   removed.

 - Remove use of L0DU and L1Decision packages from DaVinci requirements.
   It is not necessary to reprocess new data. Not garanteed to give same
   rejection factor on TDR data
   Options are kept for convenience if necessary in the future.   
 
 - Adapt to new XmlDDDB geoemtry descriptions.
   . Introduce new XmlDDDB dependent file lhcb-200311.opts and use this in 
     generic DaVinciDDDB.opts
   . Remove DaVinciv254r1.opts and DaVinciv256r0.opts that can cause crashes
     when reading TDR data.
