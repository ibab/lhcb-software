!======================= STMonitors v3r2 2010-06-21 ==========================
! 2010-06-08 - Mark Tobin
 - Some bug fixes in the NZS monitoring algorithm
   - Pedestal method of noise tools were returning the values after pedestal was
   substracted.  Now returns the mean ADC value before pedestal substraction.
 - More robust calculation of MPV in cluster monitoring.
   - Three means are calculated. 
   1) Truncated mean using 70% of the distribution
   2) Truncated mean using only the 1st 70% of the distribution
   3) Binned mean with 20 bins from 0 to 100 ADC counts
   - The MPV is currently taken as the 3rd mean. 
   - This method updates the MPV after 1000 clusters by default.
   - It no longer uses/resets root histograms so the landau for each sector
   will be stored as a histogram online.
 - MPV map is still calculated as 2d profile from analysis of MVP map and
 normalisation histogram.
 - STNoiseCalculation changed to GaudiAlgorithm and not STBaseAlg as it doesn't
 care about the detector type.
 - Add options for monitoring TAE NZS events

! 2010-06-01 - Mark Tobin
 - Use new noise tool interface to only update NZS plots for TELL1s which have
 sent NZS data.  Hopefully fixes issues running on round robin data.

 STErrorMonitor.

 - Plus some extra bug fixes.
