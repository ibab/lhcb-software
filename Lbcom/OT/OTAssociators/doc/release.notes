   to the channelIDs which are also the keys. Note one cannot use the relations
   like interface anymore to retrieve the MC information. See the code or doxygen
   for examples on how to retrieve the information.

!===================== OTAssociators v4r1 2006-07-24 =====================

! 2006-02-15 - Marco Cattaneo
 - In requirements, migrate to DigiEvent

! 2006-02-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Use consistent convention for output locations of all linkers:
   ('/Event/Link/'+) xxxLocation             for links from xxx to MCParticle
   ('/Event/Link/'+) xxxLocation + '2MCHits' for links from xxx to MCHits

! 2006-02-08 - Jan Amoraal
 - Use OTTime for truth tables and see what happens 

! 2006-02-05 - Jan Amoraal
 - Use MCOTTime and not OTTime, assuming there is one to one 
   correspondence, for truth tables. 		       
 - Bug fix. Use correct paths and check status code associateToTruth 
  
! 2006-01-31 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Removed obsolete files and directories. Now a pure component package

! 2006-01-30 - Jan Amoraal 
 - Migrated to LHCb v20r0.
 - Introduced linkers (needs testing)

   tables and are'nt need anymore.

 - Add OTTime2MCHitLinker algorithm to create "Linker" association
   table, and add it to DataOnDemandSvc in OTAssociators.opts
 - Adapt OTTime2MCParticleAlg and OTTime2MCHitAlg to look for OTTimes2MCHits
   Linker table first, build Relations table if Linker table is not found.

!====================== OTAssociators v3r1 2004-11-22 ======================   
! 2004-11-22 - Marco Cattaneo

 - Move to the New Gaudi Base Classes

!====================== OTAssociators v3r0 2004-09-10 ======================   
! 2004-08-30 - Jacopo Nardulli 
 - Backward incompatible modifications in the general structure of the package 
   due to the New OT Event Model. 
   Only 3 associations still exist: OTTime to MCParticle, OTTime to MCHit, 
   OTTime to MCOTDeposit.	 

!====================== OTAssociators v2r9 2004-07-19 ======================   
! 2004-07-19 - Marco Cattaneo    
 - Add dependency to new Relations package

!====================== OTAssociators v2r8 2004-04-19 ======================

!====================== OTAssociators v2r7 2003-12-16 ======================
! 2003-12-16 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Move to Gaudi v14 (use OTEvent v13r0 in requirements)

!====================== OTAssociators v2r6 2003-07-15 ======================
! 2003-07-15 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - OTDigit2MCxxx associators use a weighted associator, where the weight is 
   an integer which refers to a tdc-time in the vector of tdc-times in 
   the OTDigit.
 - The OTCluster2MCxxx associators use their OTDigit2MCxxx counterparts to
   make the association. The integer stored in the OTDigit2MCxxx relation
   table is used to select only the relation with the tdc-time corresponding
   to the OTCluster.
 - OTDigit2MCDeposit is the base associator for all others.

!====================== OTAssociators v2r5 2003-06-17 ======================
! 2003-06-09 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added associators: OTDigits to MCOTDeposits, to MCHits and to MCParticles.

! 2003-01-17 - Sebastien Ponce
 - support for gcc 3.2

!====================== OTAssociators v2r4 2003-01-08 ======================
! 2002-12-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Release tools at finalise

!===================== OTAssociators v2r3 2002-12-05 ====================
! 2002-10-30 - Florence Ranjard
 - requirements - use new versions

!====================== OTAssociators v2r2 2002-10-21 ======================
! 2002-10-16 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - The associators are now able to have more than one
   deposits/hits/particles associated to one cluster. Deposits (or hits or
   particles) which are lost due to dead time can be recovered when they
   are within a given time-window from the first deposit.
 - This time window can be set with a job-option.

!====================== OTAssociators v2r1 2002-10-04 ======================
! 2002-09-26 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - OTCluster2MCHitAlg now makes use of OTCluster2MCDepositAlg.

! 2002-08-07 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added class descriptions.
 - removed log messages.

!====================== OTAssociators v2r0 2002-07-09 =======================
! 2002-07-05 - Jeroen van Tilburg
 - Added flag decide to store the relation of OTClusters with 
   MCHits/MCParticles from spillover.
 - This flag is set to false: no relation with spillover is stored.

! 2002-07-4 - Rutger Hierck
 -  Added a associcator between OTCluster and OTMCDeposit.
    This is to find the right ambiguity.
      - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCDepositAsct.h
      - OTCluster2MCDepositAlg

! 2002-06-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Chanve version to v2r0 to use EventKernel v2r*

!========================= OTAssociators v1r0 2002-05-27 ================
! 2002-05-27 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Use more standard TDS path for location of relations tables
 - Add relation factories to OTAssociators_load.cpp

! 2002-05-27 J. van Tilburg
  This is a new package to associate the Outer Tracker classes with 
  Monte Carlo information.
  Two algorithms to build the relations:
  - OTCluster2MCHitAlg
  - OTCluster2MCParticleAlg
  Two associator tools:
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCHitAsct.h
  - OTAssociators/OTCluster2MCParticleAsct.h
