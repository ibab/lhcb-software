 - Merged in changes from branch spradlin_20150615.
   For detailed descriptions of the changes, please see the doc/release.notes
   of the spradlin_20150615 branch.  Briefly:
   . Several bug fixes
   . Much rearrangement of code.
   . Major campaign to bring line names for the exclusive lines into a common
     convention.  The convention that i applied follows:
    Descriptive and unambiguous:  for each Hlt2 line in CharmHad that
      reconstructs an exclusive final state, the line name must fully and
      unambiguously describe the _physics_ decay mode.  Since the
      reconstructed decay mode sometimes differs from the physics mode for
      technical reasons, the line should describe the intended physics rather
      than the technical implementation.  If there are more than one line for
      a physics mode, additional description strings for the line should be
      appended to the name after an underscore, e.g., _LTUNB and _XSec.
    Sub-decays:  reconstructed subdecays must be full described.  Underscores
      will be used to separate subdecays from the top level decay and from
      each other.
    Particle ordering:  order the names of decay products by decreasing
      mass from left to right.  For particles with the same mass, e.g.
      conjugates, put the negatively charged one first.  The same ordering
      should be applied to subdecays when there are multiple subdecays at the
      same level:  list the heaviest subdecay first.
    'To' or '2':  i prefer 'To' to represent the decay operator in a decay
      formula, but either is acceptable as long as it does not introduce
      ambiguity.
    Charge conjugate decays:  the name should describe just one of the
      conjugate decays; 'DpToKS0Pip', not 'DpmToKS0Pipm'.  If a line does
      not select both conjugate decays of a final state that is not
      self-conjugate, the name must contain an additional description to this
      affect.
    Electric charge:  when the electric charge is part of the usual symbol for
      a particle, include it in the name, 'p' for positively charged, 'm' for
      negatively charged, '0' for neutral:  'Km', 'Kp', 'KS0', but 'Eta'.
      An exception is the proton, which should be 'Pp' or 'Pm' despite the
      usual symbols for proton and antiproton having no electrical charge.
    Camel case:  capitalize the first letter of each particle name.
    KS0 abbreviation:  when the reconstructed decay uses only 'long-long' or
      only 'down-down' KS0, this should be noted in the name.  The
      abbreviations KS0LL and KS0DD can be used in these cases as a combined
      subdecay and additional description.
    Pi0 abbreviation:  when the reconstructed decay uses only 'merged' or
      'resolved' calorimeter Pi0, this should be noted in the name.  The
      abbreviations Pi0M and Pi0R can be used in these cases as a combined
      subdecay and additional description.
    Eta abbreviations:  for calorimeter etas, use the same convention as for
      Pi0:  EtaR and EtaM can be used as combined subdecay and additional
      description to indicate respectively resolved or merged
      eta -> gamma gamma.  Use 'Etap' for eta^{prime}.  This does clash with
      the charge convention, but it should not cause ambiguity.
    Joint mass windows:  Often mass windows are specified wide enough to
      cover multiple particles exclusively reconstructed to the same final
      state.  This is common for D+ and D_s+ decays.  When this is the case,
      all of the intended particles should be listed before the 'To' or '2' in
      order of increasing mass, e.g., DpDspTo....
    Common particle names to be used:  Pim, Pip, Pi0, Km, Kp, KS0, Eta, Phi.
      Pp = proton, Lam = Lambda.  G = photon.  D0, Dp, Dsp.  Dstp = D^{*+},
      Dst0 = D^{*0}, Dsstp = D_s^{*+}.  Lcp = Lambda_c^+, Sc0 = Sigma_c^0, Scp,
      Scpp = Sigma_c^{++}.  Xic0, Xicp, Omc0 = Omega_c^0.

! 2015-04-16 - Michael Alexander
  - CharmHad/Hc2HHHHLines.py & CharmHad/Stages.py :
    - Changed the inputs of the detached Xic0->pKKpi line to the same as those
      for the LTUNB line in the same mode for the tight PID cuts. IP chi2 cuts
      are now performed only in the daughter cuts of the combiner. This brings
      the timing down to more manageable levels (particularly sharing inputs
      makes a surprisingly large difference).

  - Some code cleaning in CharmHad/Stages.py
    . Prepended 'CharmHad' to the names of shared instances of filters for
      basic particles.  Most of these had very generic names that might
      eventually conflict with similar filters in other directories.
    . Bring D02HHLines.py closer to a 'standard' form.
      - Removed the ability to change the slot name in the constructor of
        D02HHLines.CharmHadD02HHLines

    .  plan to add HyperonLambdaX_DDD later

! 2015-04-14 - Patrick Spradlin

      in_range.  Added dependence on PV3D('Hlt2') required by use of BPVLTIME.


! 2015-04-13 - Mike Sokoloff
  - CharmHadWithKs:  removed this subdirectory; one set of HHKs algorithms is obsolete;
                     the other has been moved into CharmHad.
  - CharmHad:        created two new classes:
			KsFilterForHHKs with instances
			  SharedKsLL
			  SharedKsDD
                        These have decay time cuts (really only relevant for KsLL) and VZ
                         cuts. They may be useful as inputs for additional lines
			HHKshCombiner with instances
			  D02KsPiPi_LL

			  D02KsKPi_LL
			  D02KsKPi_DD

  . Detached J/psi -> mumu and B+ -> (J/psi -> mumu)K+
  . Same with J/psi -> ee
  . Same with electrons from L0 candidates only
  . Detached phi -> mumu and Ds+ -> (phi -> mumu)pi+
  . KS0 long-long
  . Lambda0 long-long: filtered from common particles, highP, isMuon lines
  . downstream-downstream KS0 and Lambda0 lines turned off by default

 - Add 3-body XSection lines to CharmHad
 - Following discussions at the charm meeting and looking into the stripping lines,
   tighten the shared particle PID cuts in CharmHad a bit (still looser than current stripping cuts!)
   to reduce combinatorics timing. We may want to tighten these further still, but let's discuss as we go along.
 - Tighten shared particle IPCHI2 cuts to at least > 4 everywhere in CharmHad
   (except for lifetime unbiased of course) again to help reduce combinatorics timing
 - Rename the D02HHCombiner in Stages.py to be the DetachedD02HH..., in line with naming convention,
   propagate this through and add a different D02HHCombiner for the eventual lifetime unbiased lines.
 - Add the 2DD and LLDD D->KS0KS0 lines
 - Add a D->3h line for KPi calibration for Mika
 - Introduce ALL, >= 1, >= 2 layered PT cuts for the D->3H lines in line with the layered IPCHI2 cuts
   and set to the minimal values used in the 2015 draft XSec stripping lines throughout
 - Tighten non-XSec D->HHH/Lc->HHH lines to come closer to what is done in the stripping, modulo differences in logic.

   Modification to the filter on the number of tracks in an event (aliases GEC,
   KillTooManyIPFilter, etc.) so that the filter is always present in the
   sequence regardless of the properties.  The presence of the filter in
   the line sequences is no longer conditional on the property ComRobUseGEC.
   Setting ComRobUseGEC to False will configure the filter as pass-all rather
   than omitting it.

! 2010-02-22 - V. Gligorov
 - Contine the reorganization of Hlt tracking, see Savannah 13784, 12691
   for details. Major changes in this round
   . All Hlt2Lines which specifically asked for primary vertices
     now pick them up from HltPVs, not HltReco.
   . Remove hardcoded track location in topological/charm/b2dx trigger
     line global event cuts. The correct container is now automatically picked
     up by asking the Hlt2 reconstruction for it.
   . Remove hardcoded location of hlt2 velo tracks in the displaced
     vertex lines, this is also now picked up by asking the Hlt2
     reconstruction for it.

!========================== Hlt2Lines v2r4 2010-02-17 ===================
! 2010-02-18 - V. Gligorov
 - Updates to inclusive triggers (Charm,Topo,Phi,B2DX) to follow changes

   Minor sequencing fix.

! 2010-01-13 - Patrick Spradlin
  https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?59641
 - Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
   Reorganized the sequencing to remove the logical OR dependence on input
   kaons and pions.  This was achieved by making the 2-body reconstruction
   depend only on kaons rather than on the OR of kaons and pions.
   Dependence on pions enters at the 3-body reconstruction, and there it is
   introduced as an element in an ordinary sequencer.  Explicit dependence
   on PV3D has also been introduced prior to IP cuts on the input particles.

! 2010-01-12 - Patrick Spradlin
 - Separation of charm lines and topological lines.
   . Hlt2TopologicalLines.py: removal of charm lines and all code used
     exclusively by the charm lines.
   + Hlt2CharmLines.py: New configurable for the charm lines.  Contains all of
     the code required to define the charm lines from the previous version of
     Hlt2TopologicalLines.py.
   . This separation preserves the structure of the charm and topological
     triggers unchanged.
   . I have taken this opportunity to remove the symbol `Topo' from the names
     of all of the components of the charm lines, so there is no longer any
     excuse to call the charm trigger the `charm topo' or the `topo for charm'.
   . The Hlt/HltSettings tag spradlin_2010Jan12 relies on this change.

      purpose is better implemented at higher level by the ActiveHlt2Lines
      mechanism in the HltSettings.
    . Put wrapper sequences around GooPions and GoodKaons to prevent some
      problems introduced by including them in the same sequence
      (Hlt2SharedTopo2Body_PionsORKaons) with ShortCircuit = False.

! 2009-08-10 - Gerhard Raven
 - update ANNSvc name in Hlt2InclusivePhi

! 2009-08-07 - Magnus Lieng & Kim Vervink
 - Inclusive Phi code cleanup
 - IncPhiTF line renamed to IncPhiTrackFit.
   Reason: Two algs ended up with same name.
   'Hlt2' + 'IncPhi' + 'TFCombine' == 'Hlt2' + 'IncPhiTF' + 'Combine'

!========================== Hlt2Lines v1r5 2009-08-04 ===================

  - updated InclusiveMuon and InclusiveDiMuon .py files/configurables:
  	* latest cuts for each line, including some prescales
    * some changes in code to prepare lines for different trigger scenarios
	    (include lines slot and no hardwired prescale factors outside slots)

! 2009-07-31 - Gerhard Raven
 - minor tweaks to displaced vertex line, eg. rename the vertex
   search from Hlt2PatPV3D to Hlt2DisplVerticesV3D

! 2009-07-31 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Bu2LLXLines : Make a three step selection:
   1. Require a dimuon or dielectron
   2. Full track fit
   3. Build Bu->llK candidate
 - Does not work yet as Calo options are not compatible

! 2009-07-31 - Kim Vervink
 - Extra line in the Inclusive Phi stream: larger phi mass window and prescale

!========================== Hlt2Lines v1r4 2009-07-23 ===================

! 2009-07-29 - Geraldine Conti
- Update of the HLT2 exclusive selections for Bs->JpsiPhi, Bd->JpsiK*
   and Bu->JpsiK+ in the Hlt2B2JpsiXLines.py file

! 2009-07-29 - Young Min Kim
 - Added Hlt2B2PhiXLines.py for Bs->PhiPhi selection

! 2009-07-22 - Patrick Koppenburg for Neal Gauvin
 - Add displaced vertices line

! 2009-07-21 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Moved B->LLK lines from HltSelections

! 2009-07-21 - Geraldine Conti

!========================== Hlt2Lines v1r3 2009-07-03 ===================

! 2009-07-03 - Leandro de Paula
  - update in Inclusive DiMuons
                * set lower rate

! 2009-07-02 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Remove obsolete selections (see HltSelections package)

! 2009-06-29 - Antonio Perez-Calero
  - update in Inclusive Muon and Muon+Track lines:
		* disable MuTrack4JPsi (use case still under study)
		* set mid rate (400 Hz) single mu and mu+track selections as default (active)

! 2009-06-29 - Patrick Spradlin
  - Several changes to python/Hlt2Lines/Hlt2TopologicalLines.py
    * Changed default behavior of the 'GEC' limit on the number of tracks in
      an event.  It is now ON by default.
    * Rearranged some cuts to reduce the number of 4-body combinations
      transferred to the TES.
    * Turned the 4-body topological and charm lines back ON by default.
      For the moment, the 4-body DX line remains OFF by default.
    * Changed the way cut strings are built to use python's sprintf-style
      line formatting rather than string concatenation.

! 2009-06-28 - Leandro de Paula
  - migration of Biased DiMuon lines (4 lines)

! 2009-06-28 - Gerhard Raven
  - move some import statements in Hlt2B2JpsiX to avoid 'premature' import

! 2009-06-26 - V. Gligorov & P. Spradlin
  - Add GEC machinery for the Hlt2Topological lines. It is now possible to
    cut on the number of tracks in an event and reject events which have too many
    tracks. Off by default -- switch on by setting ComRobUseGEC to true. Set
    ComRobGEC to adjust the cut value (default 120 tracks).
  - Add cut on the charge of the final 2,3, and 4 body candidates of the charm lines.
    The 2,4 body are required to have charge zero, the 3 body charge +-1.
  - Other minor changes to improve code usability.

! 2009-06-26 - V. Gligorov
  - Fixed a number of silly bugs in XGamma lines.

! 2009-06-24 - Greig Cowan
  - Added "prescaled and detached" exclusive Bs->JpsiPhi selection to
    Hlt2B2JpsiX.py.
