	 to problems if property were not the default!

   TrackSys is instantiated in ConfiguredFitters, which is used by Hlt2Tracking.

   TrNVELOMISS to 100.
 - Removed the possibility of assigning track errors without track fit.

! 2015-02-02 - Michael Kolpin

   there. Structured in a similar manner as Hlt2Tracking.py to allow for simple integration.
 - Added "FullSeeding" to Hlt1TrackNames.py, needed for FullDownstream tracking

! 2015-01-29 - Sascha Stahl

   or rerun reconstruction. VetoObjects are used such that algorithms do not run
   if their output location already exists.
 - HLT2 Forward runs on unused hits of HLT1 Forward. Added option to fit and filter
   tracks before flagging hits and Velo seeds. This is similarly done for the Seeding.
 - Moved the configuration of algorithms from Hlt2Tracking.py to HltSharedTracking.py
   and HltRecoConf.py.

     use it to make pi0s.
   . Add genuine NoPIDs ProtoParticles, which are not overwritten with
     PID information by other tools.
   . Remove the options UseRICH and UseCALO and replace them with methods
     to get RICH-IDd and CALO-IDd protoparticles.
   . Remove the option to both RICH and CALO ID charged hadrons.
   . Fix assorted bugs.

! 2010-03-23 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks #12691,13784.
   Split the neutral reconstruction into charged and neutral parts,
   so that lines which need electrons do not make photons, and that we
   don't ID electrons when making photons. Add a tracking configuration
   for making neutrals.

! 2010-03-17 - V. Gligorov
 - Continuing work on Savannah tasks #12691,13784.

	- src/HltTrackSelector.h : updating the tool to select a track for DC06.
  - src/HltTracking.h : master algorithm to drive most of the reconstruction in the HLT code.
    It has different three configurations: for Velo,VeloTT,and Forward
    It has two modes:
       1) Takes a Hlt::TrackContainer (a selection of tracks), it returns
the reconstructed tracks in an output Hlt::TrackContainer.
          For each track, it checks if was already reconstructed, and if so, it will the track not be reconstructed again.
      2) With no logical containers, assumes that the rest of the input tracks in the origial pat-container needs to be reconstructed. So, it finished the reconstruction.
       i.e if it algorithms it is call with the configuration: Velo. It will loop in all the tracks in the Velo RZ track container, if the tracks has not been reconstructed a Velo Space yet, then it will be reconstructed. The final output will be in the pat-container, and copied, if needed into a logical Hlt::TrackContainer.

  - src/ removing HltForward and HltVeloTT algorithms: using HltTrackSelector tool instead
    src/HltTrackSelector.h .cpp tool to decide when to accpet a track to track
        use an options with mode: selected, rest, all

! 2006-01-19 Jose A. Hernando
	- cmt/requirements
	  depends on Pat-packages, and Hlt and Track Event Model
  - src/HltForward
    algorithm to steer the Forward reconstruction
    modes of operation (via option) = "selected","rest","all"
    track the seed Tracks that has been "selected", the one not-selected, or all
  - src/HltVeloTT
    algorithm to steer the VeloTT reconstruction
    modes of operation (via option) = "selected","rest","all"
    track the seed Tracks that has been "selected", the one not-selected, or all
