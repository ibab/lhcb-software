   (input paricles and rates for various filtering stages)
 - replace std::uniqu_ptr with single automatic instabce
   (actually move from strategy  2 to strategy 3  - see DaVinciKernel/tests)


! 2015-04-01 - Vanya Belyaev
 - fix the issue with particle -> PV association

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r6 2015-03-31 =========================

! 2015-03-31 - Vanya Belyaev

 - reshuffle a bit Hlt1Combiner & Hlt1CombinerConf

! 2015-03-30 - Roel Aaij
   Significant changes in Hlt1 upgrade code.
 - Remove previous mechanism of double work prevention and replace it with
   relations tables.
 - Remove unused and probably broken MultiTrack upgrade code.
 - Simplify inheritance structure of UpgradeTracks.
 - Allow an TES location to be passed to the constructor of UpgradeTracks. This
   will be interpreted as an external cache that is checked for the existence of
   previously upgraded seeds. This implements the complement upgrade.

   Move development of photons in Hlt1 to branch v15r5b.

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r5 2014-03-09 =========================

! 2015-03-06 - Vanya Belyaev
 - add particle and protoparticle cuts into selection source:
   it allows to save some code for combiners :

           Selection ( name , predicates )


! 2015-02-19 - Matthew Kenzie
 - addition of ToProtoParticles() (avoids repeat creation)
 - minor changes in ToParticles() to facilitate this (including sligthly different solution to Vanya's fix below)
 - addition of Hlt1CombinerConf() to avoid having to pass huge strings in Hlt1Lines
 - change of Hlt1Combiner() to pick input stream and possible additional inputs if necessary

! 2015-02-15 - Vanya Belyaev
 - minor fix in ToParticles

! 2015-02-06 - Roel Aaij
 - Add extra protection against loading non-existent PV selection in HltUnit.

! 2015-02-03 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Hlt2 also works from cache!

! 2015-01-29 - Vanya Belyaev
 - !!! It works !!! (Caching functors in C++ source)

! 2015-01-26 - Vanya Belyaev
 - comment out binders... it looks like they are not used at all..

! 2015-01-26 - Vanya Belyaev

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r4 2014-12-15 =========================

! 2014-12-03 - Vanya Belyaev
 - add Particles into streamer functions

   update tests.py with following examples:

   ... >> TS_ISPARTICLE >> ...
   ... >> ( PT > 1    ) >> ...
   ... >> ( ID == 13  ) >> ...
   ... >>  M  >> ...

   and it works!



! 2014-11-26 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed CMake configuration.

! 2014-11-25 - Roel Aaij
 - HltUnit inherits from IDVAlgorithm to allow more particle functors to be used
   in HLT1. Most methods return NULL pointers, but the ones that we needed are
   there.

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r3 2014-09-29 =========================

! 2014-09-24 - Alex Shires
 - adding new functor - MatchTracks - which looks for matching tracks and returns a bool
 - (compare to FilterTracks, which filters and writes a new stream if the matching is successful )

! 2014-09-02 - Alex Shires
 - minor fix to TrMatch

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r2 2014-07-16 =========================

! 2014-07-10 - Sean Benson
 - Make patch more conservative
! 2014-07-08 - Sean Benson
 - Patch to UpgradeTools to avoid rare # of upgraded tracks mismatch

!========================= LoKiTrigger v15r1 2014-04-22 =========================
! 2014-04-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - follow changes in Cache interface to use Gaudi::StringKey throughout
 - follow changes in Hlt::IUnit interface to clarify memory
   ownership

! 2014-04-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - fix clang diagnostic

! 2014-03-27 - Vanya Belyaev

 - HltUnit: change the type of "Params" to std::map<std::string,double>
   to be reverted so something more reasonable [what?] after update of LoKiCore

! 2014-03-26 - Gerhard Raven
 - trivial C++11 changes

! 2014-03-11 - Vanya Belyaev

 - HltUnit

   Add new property "Params"

   Params = { 'PtMin' :  1 * GeV }

   Code = """
   ...
   >>  ( TrPT > PARAM ( 'Params[PtMin]/<Unit-name-or-regex-pattern>' ) ) >>
   ...

   """
   The format of 'Params[PtMin]/<Unit-name-or-regex-pattern>'
   is defined in $LOKICOREROOT/src/Param.cpp

   *If* parameters are redefined *after* initialiaztaion,
    and the value is actrually changed
    currently the warning is printed   (probably need to be revisited)
    but anyhow  only Eric is allowed to redefine "Params"

! 2014-11-24 - Gerhard Raven
 - run clang-format on some source files

! 2014-11-22 - Gerhard Raven
 - minor C++11 changes
 - fix bug in TrMatch: if a candidate matched multiple seeds, it would be copied
   over for _each_ matching seed instead of once.
 - adapt to changes in HltBase: use dedicated pair<INamedInterface*,string> as
   history and worker entry

! 2014-01-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration.

!========================= LoKiTrigger v14r0 2014-01-06 =========================

 - remove commented lines

! 2012-04-09 - Victor Coco
 - Fix related to UpgradeVertices and TrackCutAsRecVertexCut to avoid use of
   RecVertex adapters
    * removed from HltCandidates.* class the RecVertex filter / fun / cut and map
      and equivalent in LoKiTriggerDict.h
    * base the TrackCutAsRecVertexCut.* class on VertexBase instead of RecVertex
    * modify UpgradeVertices to access the stage as VertexBase

!========================= LoKiTrigger v12r6 2012-03-17 =========================
! 2012-03-14 - Pieter David
 - Add adapters from a RecVertex cut to a track cut, with the option to pass
   the candidate if one of the tracks passes the track cut (complementary to
   UpgradeVertices), for Hlt1 displaced vertex line

! 2012-03-12 - Pieter David
 - Add UpgradeVertices (cfr. Upgrade, UpgradeTrack etc.), required to
   forward-upgrade or fit tracks after making vertices out of them

!========================== LoKiTrigger v12r4 2011-08-29 ===================
! 2011-07-20 - Vanya Belyaev

 - move BeamLineFunctions.h into Phys/LoKiPhys
     enabling "Hlt-free" DaVinci

 - cmt/requirements
     version increment to v12r4

!========================== LoKiTrigger v12r3 2011-06-24 ===================
! 2011-06-07 - Vanya Belyaev
 - fix almost all ICC warnings

! 2011-06-03 - Vanya Belyaev

 - BeamLineFunctions
   fix problmes with copy constructor

   In practice it doe snto affect trigger,
   but it could affect offline processing and especially MC processing

   many thanks to Steve Blusk for pointing to the problem

 - cmt/requirements
     version increment to v12r3

!========================== LoKiTrigger v12r2 2011-05-04 ===================
! 2011-05-04 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix a bug in UpgradeTool where the extraInfo field for the recoID on a seed
   would be it's key instead of the number of resulting output tracks if the
   underlying tool does not modify the track but returns the track itself.

! 2011-04-29 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix L0CaloCut wrongly flagged as never having a threshold.
 - Set instant suppression for Error and Warning in Hlt1 track upgrade
   functors.

! 2011-04-10 - Roel Aaij
 - updated documentation of BeamLineFunctions.h

! 2011-04-10 - Roel Aaij
 - Add TrFilter.{h,cpp} which contains FilterTracks; a functor for track
   filtering in Hlt1 streamers using ITrackSelector tools. This functor
   prevents double work. Python symbol:

   TC_FILTER_TR

!========================== LoKiTrigger v12r1 2011-03-29 ===================

! 2011-03-29 - Roel Aaij
 - Align behaviour of MatchTool with the implementations of the interface it
   uses, PatMatchTool in particular. The behaviour exported by the ITrackMatch
   is not interpreted very cleanly. Since the return value is used to signal
   successful matching and cuts are not on the quality arguments but on
   internal properties, the quality function arguments are effectively obsolete.
   A change of interface to remove them should be considerd.
   Because allow the cuts to be stored as propeties in the TCK.
 - Update check for being closed also when functor is created.

! 2011-03-29 - Roel Aaij
 - Add LoKi.Vertices.BeamSpot functor.
   This functor handles the required Velo resolver condition and exports
   the derived position of the beamspot x and y coordinates through functions.
   The BeamSpotRho function now inherits from it.
 - Whether the Velo is open is now determined from the distance between it's
   halves and the their average.

! 2011-03-27 - Vanya Belyaev

 - 1. add di-track creator from the stream

       TC_DITRACKS2

   2. add interpretation of "track-vector-function (FunVal&CutVal)"
      inside TC-stream as corresponding "scalar" functor that needs
      to be applied to underlying Hlt::MultiTrack

      e.g. following stream-element filters MULTITRACKS with scalar PT-sum:

        " ... >>   ( 1 < sum ( TrPT ) >> ... "


! 2011-03-18 - Vanya Belyaev
 - add protection against double lock

 - cmt/requirements
     version increment to v12r1

!========================== LoKiTrigger v12r0 2011-03-17 ===================
! 2011-03-17 - Roel Aaij
 - Add a bit better protection in VxSink

! 2011-03-16 - Victor Coco
 - update BeamSpotRho function with threshold
   to ensure the velo is closed
   replace m_veloDet by m_condition in LoKiTrigger.xml

! 2011-03-15 - Vanya Belyaev
 - update BeamSpotRho function

! 2011-03-12 - Vanya Belyaev

 - kill Elements...

! 2011-03-11 - Vanya Belyaev

 - BeamLineFunctions:
     remove DeVelo
     use Condition

! 2011-03-11 - Vanya Belyaev
 - kill bad concept of "Element"-functor
 - cmt/requirements
     version increment to v12r0

! 2011-03-10 - Vanya Belyaev

 - LoKi/BeamLineFunctions.h
   srs/BeamLineFunctions.cpp

    add *skeleton* for VX_BEAMSPOTRHO functor

      " ...  >> ( VX_BEAMSPOTRHO() > 5 * mm ) >> ... "

 - cmt/requirements

     1. add dependency on VeloDet
     2. version increment to v11r10

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r9 2011-03-06 ===================
! 2011-03-06 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix a performance bug in UpgradeTool, leftover from r117500. When a seed
   does not pass the upgrade, this is now also flagged and seen.

! 2011-03-05 - Roel Aaij
 - Change RvSelection into VxSelection and RvRegister into VxSink.
   The new functors are based on VertexBase instead of RecVertex, but still
   use Hlt::TSelection< LHCb::RecVertex >. This allows filtering of Hlt
   vertex selections using LoKi::Vertices functors.
 - Add python symbols:
   VX_SINK, VX_SELECTION
 - Decorate vertex sources
 - Removed a large unused section from LoKiTrigger.xml

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r8 2011-03-01 ===================
! 2011-03-01 - Gerhard Raven
 - enable code which requires LHCb v32r1

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r7 2011-02-22 ===================
! 2011-02-20 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove code which uses the match2dVelo interface -- we don't use
   2D velo anymore ;-)

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r6 2011-02-19 ===================
! 2011-02-13 - Vanya Belyaev
 - dict/LoKiTriggerDict.h
   fix wrong name/typo for python's "right-side-multiplication" operator

! 2011-02-11 - Roel Aaij
 - Fixed the UpgradeTool for the case when the seed was already flagged as
   having been upgraded, but no new track was created and registered in the TES.
   If a tool does not own what it produces and the seed is flagged, return it.

! 2011-02-11 - Vanya Belyaev

 - add the tretament of track<--->candidate matching for MatchTool.

 - add "match-as-filter" concept and corresponding symbols:

     TC_MATCHFLTR and TC_MATCHFLTR2

 - cmt/requirements

      version increment to v11r6

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r5 2011-02-10 ===================
! 2011-02-10 - Roel Aaij
 - Fixed the UpgradeTool to correctly flag seeds and look for already upgraded
   candidates in accordance with the current "model", where the Candidates are
   unique per line.
   Please note that the logic for MultiTracks has not been checked and as a
   safeguard, calls will always return FAILURE.

! 2011-02-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Identified and fixed a flaw in the logic of the use of IsAncestor. Fixed
   for single track, needs to be checked for multitracks.
   Looking in the past to be fixed.

! 2011-02-08 - Vanya Belyaev

 - UpgradeTool:

     force TES-registration of tracks not yer registered

! 2011-02-08 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove Warning about 'reconstruction causes split candidates' as this
   the expected behaviour

! 2011-02-07 - Roel Aaij
 - Add missing entry for VxMaker4 to dictionary.

! 2011-02-07 - Vanya Belyaev

 - "re-add" timers

 - allow "right-side" usage of gate with pipes both with ">>" and "*"

 - add new symbol TC_VXMAKER4

     for vertex making via pairing of all tracks form the stream

 - add possibility to specify "simple" track cust fo rupgrade an dmatch tools:

    xxx = LoKi.Hlt1.UpgradeConf (
            ... ,
            ( TrPT > 0.5 * GeV ) & ( TrCHI2NDOF < 3 )
           )

    yyy = LoKi.Hlt1.MatchConf (
            ... ,
            ( TrPT > 0.5 * GeV ) & ( TrCHI2NDOF < 3 )
           )

    The cut (if specified) does NOT affect the actual track upgrade
    all upgraded tracks are properly registered, treated etc,
    but only "good" tracks goes into the stream.  This prevents
    double reconstruction...

 - cmt/requirements
      version increment to v11r5

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r4 2011-02-07 ===================

 - tag as v11r4

 - cmt/requirements
      version increment to v11r4

! 2011-02-07 - Roel Aaij
 - UpgradeTool and MatchTool now get public tools.

! 2011-02-06 - Gerhard Raven
 - undo the addition of timers temporarily until the release
   on top of LHCB_v32r0 has been done, as the relevant code
   is not in v32r0 (will be in the next release). The addition
   can be replayed by inverting 'svn merge -r116908:116907 .'


! 2011-02-03 - Vanya Belyaev

 - Hlt.py
   new module with decoration of Hlt Event model classes

    - add easy iteration over SmartRefVector<HltStage>
    - add TRIVIAL iteration over the content of Hlt::Candidate
      ( using INVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL order, accoridng to slot numbering )

      candidate = ...

      for o in candidate :

            print o

     >>> alg = ...
     >>> htl.dotAlg( alg )

   Make dot-graph for selection

     >>> sel = ...
     >>> htl.dotSel( sel )

   Make dot-graph for ALL algorithms and selections

     >>> sel = ...
     >>> htl.dotSel( sel )




! 2010-11-24 - Vanya Belyaev

 - fix the bug with "dot"-tool

! 2010-11-22 - Vanya Belyaev
 - add property "Code/Factory/Preambulo" for Track->Candidate converter


! 2010-11-03 - Alexander Mazurov

 - add new pipe functors for Candidate. Now it's possible to write something like
   Functor<TYPE,Hlt::Candidate::ConstVector> >> Functor<const STAGETYPE*, bool>,
   where STAGETYPE is any type which Hlt::Stage can store (LHCb::Track,
   	LHCb::L0MuonCandidate, LHCb::L0CaloCandidate, ... )


! 2010-11-01 - Vanya Belyaev

 - redo upgrade & match
   remove their 'track'-versions


! 2010-10-26 - Vanya Belyaev

            upgrade tracks only

     TC_UPGRADE_MT  :
            upgrade multitracks only (eithe ralltracks or selected by index)

 - cmt/requirements
    version increment to v11r2

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r1 2010-10-04 ===================
! 2010-10-02 - Vanya Belyaev

 - add more reasonable treatment of

     L0Muon   -> Track and
     L0DiMuon -> MultiTrack conversion algorithms


! 2010-09-29 - Vanya Belyaev

 - small adaptation for new structiure of LoKiCore

 - cmt/requirements

    version increment to v11r1

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r0p1 2010-09-09 ===================
! 2010-09-09 - Gerhard Raven
 - work around some Visual C++ confusion (see https://savannah.cern.ch/task/index.php?17256)

! 2010-08-31 - Gerhard Raven
 - in HltUnit, explicitly call HltSelection::setDecision on the output selections

!========================== LoKiTrigger v11r0 2010-08-26 ===================
! 2010-08-24 - Gerhard Raven
 - cleanup some const issues

! 2010-08-17 - Gerhard Raven
 - follow changes in HltBase: Hlt::TSelection now contains const T* instead of T*
 - fix typos in dictionary

! 2010-08-12 - Vanya Belyaev
 - Hlt::Unit
    - add the default preambulo (LoKiTracks+LoKiTrigger+function)

 - resurrect the symbols for Track-selecitons:

      "sources" :
             - TrSELECTION - get      track-selection by name for Hlt::IData
             - TrINPUT     - get'TES'-track-selection by name from Hlt::IData

      "sink" ( well, it is actually pipe)

             - TrREGISTER

 Thus, in cas eI[ve put not too many errors, now

    Hlt::Unit with Code =

         " TrSELECTION( 'input' ) >> ( ... )  >> TrREGISTER ('otput') >> ~TrEMPTY "

    is equivalent to HltTrackPipe and HltTrackFilter, e.g.

         " TrSELECTION( 'input' ) >> select ( TrPT > 1*GeV ) >> TrREGISTER ('otput') >> ~TrEMPTY "

     a.  TrSTIDC  ( count STChannelIDs )
     b.  TrVELOIDC (count VeloChannelIDs):

  For usage see $LOKITRIGGERROOT/python/LoKiTrigger/tests.py :

    track = LHCb.Track()

    f1  = TrIDC     (   'isVelo'   )

    f2  = TrOTIDC   (   'module',1 )
    f3  = TrOTIDC   ( 1,'module',5 )

        print f , f(track)



! 2009-12-27 - Gerhard Raven
 - also comment out TrIDC and TrOTIDC definitions, as otherwise the
   import fails because of the change below...

 - found workaround for this bug which only happens if POOL is loaded:
   remove the typedef for std::vector<unsigned int>, and use the type
   explicityly... put back LoKi/TrackIDs in dictionary, and add TrIDC and
   TrOTIDC definitions...
   see https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/index.php?60968 for more information


! 2009-12-25 - Gerhard Raven
