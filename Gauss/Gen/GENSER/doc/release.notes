 - Port by hand changes in v9r2b branches for new versions and new generators
   . Modify macro to pick native version of alpgen 2.1.4
   . Add macro to pick up rivet for the first time
   . Modify macro to pick up pythia8 latest release 170
     Note from pythia8 release note for 165: 
     "Bug fix, that 'ParticleDecays:mixB = off' did not switch off B0-B0bar 
      and Bs0-Bs0bar mixing".
   . Use interface packages for herwig++ and thepeg privately defined and not
     from LCG_interfaces to replace '++' with 'pp', needed on bash, and to 
     redefine linking statements.
 - Merge change r143057 from v9r3b by Patrick Robbe (2012-07-23)
   . Add UPVETO function (mainly for ALPGEN)
 - Remove macros for obsolete generators no longer in use
   . herwig
   . jimmy
 - Remove all linking for photos (fortran)
 - Modify macros to use latest version of the generators
   . herwig++ and thepeg native versions 2.6.1a and 1.8.1

 - Move from EvtGen definition of PYTHIA8DATA
 - Move from EvtGen macro definitions for tauola++ and photos++
 - The use of private interfaces to replace those of LCG requires LCG_Settings 
   that has to be in sync with LCGCMT. The private interfaces will be forwarded
   to LCG to be included in their release once validated for remote usage

 - Remove definitions of macros but for version for AlpGen as an interface 
   package now exist in LCG_GeneratorsInterfaces

   for lhapdf, so that correct dependency from HepMC is taken

!========================== GENSER v9r2 2011-09-20 ===========================

!========================== GENSER v9r0 2011-04-12 ===========================
! 2011-02-11 - Patrick Robbe
 - requirements: move use hijing in GENSER to force preloading of the
   HIJING data blocks

! 2011-01-31 - Gloria CORTI
 - Put back changes in requirements and hijing directory (see entry of 
   2010-09-14 and 2010-09-17) to commission the use of Hijing 1.36.a.2
   from the LCG release area

!========================== GENSER v8r0 2010-12-13 ===========================
! 2010-12-12 - Gloria Corti
 - Rename back RLU_HIJING to RLU as we kept the older version of Hijing

! 2010-12-10 - Gloria Corti
 - Put back previous version of LHAPDF 5.7.1 for MC10, as we did not have
   the time to do the necessary tests.
 - Set version to v8r0 to indicate series for MC10.

! 2010-12-07 - Gloria CORTI
 - Use latest version of LHAPDF 5.8.4 

! 2010-12-01 - Gloria CORTI
 - Use latest version of Pythia6 424.2 to check it for possibly adopting it
   for MC10
 - Use latest version of Pythia8: recommendation from P.Skands is to use at
   least 412 as it has bug fixes and that 415 was only a minor update. 
   Take 415 as it is the latest.
 - Go back to use hijing 1.383bs.2 for next release of Gauss as it does not
   work out of the box. Will need to review the interface algorithm.

! 2010-10-07 - Patrick Robbe
 - Adapt to Pythia 6.423:
   * remove src/pythia6/pyevnw.F src/pythia6/pyptfs.F which are not needed
     anymore
   * update src/pythia6/pyrand.F src/pythia6/pyscat.F src/pythia6/pysigh.F

! 2010-09-17 - Gloria CORTI
 - requirements: increase version of pythia6 to 423.2 to allow to check it
   against 421.2
 - Noticed that the new version of hijing is calling "rlu_hijing" instead or
   "rlu". Modified name of function in file in src/hijing/rlu.F. Function 
   "ran" instead does not seem to be called, so do not touch it.

! 2010-09-14 - Gloria CORTI
 - requirements: use hijing 1.36.a.2 newly installed in LCG MCGenerators. 
   This version is orginally from Alice.  
   Routines and common blocks from pythia and jetset are renamed:
   "_hijing" added to the names. This way hijing hopefully can be used
   together with pythia.
   NMXHEP for HEPEVT is 10000, PHEP and VHEP in double precision.

!========================== GENSER v7r0 2010-07-09 ===========================
! 2010-06-21 - Patrick Robbe

   was undefined

!========================== GENSER v6r1 2009-12-04 ===========================
! 2009-11-30 - Gloria CORTI
 - In the LHAPDF LCG_Generators distribution the data files directory path has 
   changed with an additional 'lhapdf' introduced. The old one now has a 
   soft link to the new area.
   Change the LHAPATH to point directly to the new area, to facilitate 
   distribution via tarbal.

!========================== GENSER v6r0 2009-11-04 ===========================

 - Add hijing subdirectoy to contain HIJING functions overwriten in Gauss

! 2009-03-04 - Patrick Robbe

   production.
 - Add production of psi(3770) (Colo singlet, Nick Brook)

! 2008-11-11 - Patrick Robbe
 - Add new routines to overwrite in Pythia, to generate extra charmonium states:
   pyscat.F, pysghf.F pysigh.F

!========================== GENSER v4r3 2008-10-10 ===========================

!========================== GENSER v4r1 2008-06-09 ===========================
! 2008-06-09 - Gloria CORTI
 - Add routine pyevwt.F over-writing the dummy routine in pythia_dummy library
   and allowing re-weigth of cross sections for c-cbar mesons production. The
   code was provided by Marianne BARGIOTTI.

                  from LCGCMT_49 generators interface
                  Set LHAPATH variable also missing in LCGCMT_49 generators 
                  interface

                  define the necessary subroutines
                  Remove packages linkopts from GENSER_linkopts otherwise
                  present twice (already used via interface packages)
