!========================== Gauss v48r3 2015-08-05 ===========================
! 2015-08-06 - Dmitry Popov
 - Updated tests for baseline upgrade configuration and upgrade dbtags.

! 2015-08-05 - Gloria Corti
 - New tests to check fromSignal flag is set in full simulation and when
   fillinf MCPArticles from generator.
 - New test to check 2015 configuration

! 2015-08-04 - Gloria Corti
 - Update options for supported data types (2011, 2012, 2015) with latest dbase
   tags. Introduce reference options for 2010.
 - Use DecFiles v28r* to use latest decay files and chnaged in options 
   for BcVegPy, J/Psi etc.

! 2015-08-03 - Gloria Corti
 - Fix mistyping in Kine-LT.py options for values (had extra ;)
 - New options as an example to lower Production cuts, ProductionCuts-Low.py

! 2015-07-24 - Gloria Corti
 - Updated Gauss reference tests for current detector followign change in
   default random numbers generator

! 2015-07-23 - Gloria Corti
 - Provide options to Gauss() to choose between Ranlux and MTwist as random
   number engine. Set the default to Ranlux since MTwist does not re-initialize
   correctly for each event: while changing the seed at the start generates
   different samples and keeping the same causes the same set to be made, 
   successive events requires the previous one to be made to be reproduced.

   it is used also by powheg and not only bcvegpy. For physics events it
   because picked up via the options in LbPythia6 and LbPythia8 in the tests.

 - Commit new file with reference error for most tests, since info message
   from tauola is sent to stderr
 - Modify the template for the evttype tests to use the common reference 
   error file
 - Reformat some tests to make them more readable and to use the common
   reference error file. Also remove the specific error file and update 
   the reference output. Copy the new references for -opt to -dbg, 
   although they may be different they will be more similar then the old -dbg.
   To be updated or removed later.
   The tests affected are:
   . gauss-config-2011 (no reformatting, only one outpur referecence existed)
   . gauss-dev
   . gauss-dev-pythia8-30000000

   spacing is 50 ns. Use this option in qmtest gauss-dev-spillover
 - Remove the reference output and error files for slc5 32-bits that is no 
   longer supported (i686-slc5-gcc43-{opt,dbg}
 - Update the qmtests that were using the old 'Beam3500GeV...' no longer
   compatible with the Configurable to use 'Sim08-Beam3500GeV...' and remove
   it in template for the event type check because it is no longer needed
 - Modify properties of Gauss() for beam parameters:
   . remove InteractionSize(x,y,z) where x and y are not used but set
     in the BeamParameter class from beta* and emittance and where z is really
     used as RMS of the bunch, so introuduce BunchRMS property to make it
     clear what it is
   . rename BeamCrossingAngle as BeamHCrossingAngle, since it is the horizontal 
     one
   . add BeamVCrossingAngle for the vertical crossing angle and set value
     in BeamParameter (remove need of postConfigAction as for MC11)

   properties (Sim08-Beam3500GeV...) as for Sim08 for 2011 data

   default from Gauss()
 - Add new Gauss-2012.py setting beam and tags as for Sim08 for 2012 data
 - Remove obsolete Gauss-MC10.py no longer supported
 - Rename options Gauss-MC11a.py to Gauss-2011.py to reflect that they can be
   used to generate samples for 2011 with this latest version
 - Change database tags in Gauss-2011.py to use compatible one for 2011 in
   DDDB and SIMCOND. Also introduce beam transveral offset as needed by these
   tags. 
 - Adapt qmtests to use Gauss-2011.py and remove in that case the use of 
   Beam3500GeV-md100-MC11-nu2.py already in Gauss itself.
 - Change Gauss-DEV.py to use compatible DDDB tag for 2012 and DataTypes 2012
   so that latest SIMCOND tag will be picked up

! 2013-03-06 - Gloria Corti
 - The property Gauss().Output has been renamed Gauss().OutputType to be in
   line with Brunel and make clear its meaning.
   The following values can be used:
   . GEN, forced when running the Generator only phase
   . RGEN and XGEN (default), when running the Generator phase followed by
                              filling the MCParticles/MCVertices with the
                              generator information (i.e. no Geant4 processing)
   . SIM (default) and XSIM, when running also the Simulation phase

 - By default "MC/Gen/HepMCEvents" in no longer written in SIM files. In order
   to have it one has to speciy the OutputType to be the new 'XSIM'
 - "MC/Gen/HepMCEvents" is not written out when specifying the OutputType to 
   be the new 'RGEN'
 - "MC/Gen/HepMCEvents" continues to be written out in the GEN and XGEN 
   filetypes
 - Adapt the Gauss-Job.py examample and the qmtest to the change from
   Gauss().Output to Gauss().OutputType
