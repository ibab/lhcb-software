! Package     : Sim/GaussCherenkov
! Responsible	: Sajan Easo
! Purpose     : collection of sensitive detectors, G4 actions,
!               etc for RICH Upgrade
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2015-11-17 - Sajan Easo
 - Introduced creation of the hit with new RichSmartID which has now a  flag which indicates if the hit is from a largePMT
   Using this RichSmartid needs the latest version of Kernel/LHCbKernel as of this date.

! 2015-11-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CLHEP 2.

!===================== GaussCherenkov v4r5 2014-10-08 ========================
! 2014-12-04 - Sajan Easo
 - Fixes to avoid pedantic warnings during compilation.

! 2014-11-16 -Sajan Easo
 -Further modifications to histogram filling for Rich1 occupancy

! 2014-10-15 - Sajan Easo
 - Minor change in the histogram filling for Rich1 occupancy histogram during analysis

! 2014-11-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Updated CMake configuration

!===================== GaussCherenkov v4r4 2014-10-08 ========================
! 2014-10-07 - Sajan Easo
 - Minor modifications to the Cherenkov analysis in booking and filling
   histograms with new collection set.

! 2014-08-24  - Sajan Easo
 - Added the file GetMCCkvTracksAlg  to avoid problems with collection
   name in that file.
 - Kept some of the factories in Factories.cpp

! 2014-08-24  - Sajan Easo
 - For using the mixed set of PMTS, the sensitive detector and collection name
  configurations are modified. The hits from large PMTS are in a separate
  sensitive detector and are stored in two
  extra collection sets. All this is made transparent to the rest of the
  program.
  Modified several files in the SensDet subdirectory and corresponding .h files.

    latest update.

! 2013-08-09 - Jibo He
 - GaussCherenkov/CkvG4ReconFlatMirr.h
   src/CherenkovAnalysis/CkvG4ReconFlatMirr.cpp
  . Added functions to calculate distance to flat mirror plane
 - src/CherenkovAnalysis/CherenkovG4CkvRecon

  . Added histos of emis reso as function of track theta, phi

!===================== GaussCherenkov v4r0 2013-07-24 ========================
! 2013-07-19 - Sajan Easo
 - Adapations for RICH-2019 upgrade studies. Added new files mainly for the
   analysis part.
 - Rearrangeed source code in different subdirectories to avoid compilation
   warnings. Created another source code subdirectory named CkvPhysPhotDet
   as part of re-organization of source code.
 - This is all compatible with Gauss v46r1p1 onwards

 - Adaption for the recent  Gaudi v23. Moved parts of the constructor in
   CkvSensDet to its initialize method.

   initialize method.  The initialize
   and finalize methods are installed in these two classes as well.
