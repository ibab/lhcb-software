    release notes for details of improvements in speed and performance
  . Adapt the algorithm to take several inputLocations and remove the insertion
    of the muonPID and muonTrack using the key of the mother track. This change
    is necessary to produce the same value of nShared online and offline, which
    will reduce the differences in ProbNN outputs. 
  . Modify the Configuration file so as not to use the new MuonID in 2008, 2009,
    MC09 and Upgrade datatypes

- In Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r9

  . Remove list of detectors for fieldOff, as it was never used and is identical
    to list for fieldOn (in Configuration.py)

- In Rich/RichAlignment v1r11, v1r12
  . Changed from 20 bins in phi to 60 bins in phi, for the 2D histograms used

  . LHCBPS-1426 - VeloFastKalmanTrack: Initialize element (4,4) of the covariance 
    matrix to 0.0001.


- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r42
  . Add check for empty preselection vector in PatLongLivedTracking.

    (in RecoTrackingRun2.py)
  . Check that fitters in HLT1 sequence only run when the corresponding PatReco
    algorithms have run.

- In Tr/TrackExtrapolators v2r38
  . Break iteration in TrackRungeKuttaExtrapolator - evaluateRKStep if the values
    of the state are obviously too large, to prevent FPE in fieldVector
    calculation.
  . Replace ToolHandle with tool<> to get the MSScatteringTool.

    ntuples instead of histograms.
  . Added histogram with residuals vs y for every module to TTTrackMonitor
    (in 'fullDetail')

    per subdetector
  . Retrain network and flattening function for new multiple scattering
    treatment
  . Adapt StateThickMSCorrectionTool to omit log term in calculation if wanted.
    Default for the moment is: Use the log term.

    and print a line in log file of average number of real tracks per VELO track
  . Added src/VPTrackSelecor.cpp

- In Tr/TrackUtils v1r61
  . Make list of locations to erase configurable in 'TrackEraseExtraInfo', add
    print option, remove unnecessary includes, add doxygen comments.

- In Velo/VeloRecMonitors v2r31
  . VeloClusterMonitor: Added convoluted Landau-Gaussian fits of cluster ADC 
    values for offline monitoring purpose. A job option switched these fit off 
    by default.

    Tr/TrackMonitors v2r6, Tr/TrackTools v5r8, Tr/TrackUtils v1r60

- In Calo/CaloReco v5r24, v5r25
  . python/CaloReco/Configuration : in CaloProcessor : 
    give CaloProcessor-name-dependent naming for the neutralProtoPAlg and the
    algorithms updating charged ProtoP
  . Fix bad assert.
  . CaloCorrectionBase::getParams: 
    o don't create an empty vector if it won't be needed
    o cache counters by (type, areaName) instead of creating a string containing
      both every single time, and then looking them up by string

- In Muon/MuonID v9r14
  . Merge efforts of the MuonID task force from branch LHCbPS-1372.
    o Implement CommonMuonTool that offers the same functionality for both Offline
      and Hlt1.
    o Implement a DLLMuonTool that can calculate Muon DLLs using the information
      from CommonMuonTool
    o Implement MuonIDAlgLite that does the same as MuonIDAlg but using the new
      tools.

- In Pr/PrKernel v1r9
  . Add method and variable for cutting on ghost probability to IPrCounter.

- In Pr/PrMCTools v2r8
  . Adapt 'PrTrackAssociator' such that the list of classID it understands can be
    configured. Give it per default for LHCb::Track and LHCb::Track::Selection.
  . Add algorithm 'PrCheatedSciFiTracking' that performs an ideal pattern
    recognition in the SciFi.
  . Add cut on ghost probability to PrCounter. This is only set for 'Best'
    category tracks in the PrChecker. Default cut is such that it has no effect.

- In Rec/ChargedProtoANNPID v2r10
  . Add some more consistency checks to the NetConfig helper class.
  . Remove redundant status flag boolean data member from NetConfig.

- In Rec/RecConf v2r21
  . Change Configuration such that 2015 online-like tracking sequence is run when
    selecting DataType '2015'
  . Remove 'TrackContainerCopy' from 2015 PV reconstruction, as Velo and Forward
    tracks are now in separate containers.
  . Set 'IgnoreFilterPassed' to True for PV reconstruction in 2015 to not abort
    processing the rest of the event.
  . Activate by default the separate track type groups in the RICH reconstruction.
    Must be done before any 'applyConf' methods are called, in order for the
    Configurable dependencies to be correctly set up, and thus this is done from
    a new custom __init__ method of the RecSysConf Configurable.

- In Rich/RichAlignment v1r10
  . Add some logic to the alignment configurable to extract the correct
    context to use for a given set of tracks from the RichRecSys configurable.

- In Rich/RichGlobalPID v3r24, Rich/RichRecAlgorithms v2r21,
     Rich/RichRecBase v4r20, Rich/RichRecPhotonTools v1r17,
     Rich/RichRecTools v4r28, Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r40
  . Downgrade some info level printout messages to debug level.

- In Rich/RichHPDImageAnalysis v1r15
  . Make a new base class for the HPD Image analysis algorithm, that implements
    the core functionality. Allows other implications for instance in Panoptes,
    that adds 'Online' features (Camera reporting etc.) whilst still sharing the
    basic code.
  . Various small clean ups of the Image summary algorithm. C++11'ify things a
    bit. Remove loading of ODIN simply to fill a counter...

- In Rich/RichPIDMerge v2r11
  . Add a new algorithm that takes a list of RichPID TES locations and creates
    a cloned, merged output container containing all PID results.

- In Rich/RichRecBase v4r20
  . Skip summary printouts for empty selections.

- In Rich/RichRecBase v4r20, Rich/RichRecMCAlgorithms v1r6, 
     Rich/RichRecMCTools v2r32, Rich/RichRecMonitors v2r36,
     Rich/RichRecPhotonTools v1r17, Rich/RichRecStereoTools v1r10,
     Rich/RichRecTools v4r28, Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r40
  . Make some tools shared instances to avoid unnecessary duplication when
    running the RICH reconstruction with the split track groups.

- In Rich/RichRecPhotonTools v1r17, Rich/RichRecTools v4r28,
     Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r40
  . General c++11 clean up.

- In Rich/RichRecPhotonTools v1r17
  . Use LHCbMath FastRoots implementation instead of one from RichKernel.

- In Rich/RichRecQC v2r69
  . Adapt to small change in RichRecSysConf trackTypeIsActive method.
  . Add package dependency on RichRecSys.
  . Remove all calls that required access to the underlying group configurables
    in RichRecSys.
  . Add a new histogram to RichRecoQC for the track momentum distribution.
  . Update the python configurable to use the reconstuction configurable
    RichRecSysConf to determine the correct context to use for each monitor,
    based on the tracks it is monitoring.

- In Rich/RichRecSys v5r6
  . Small change in the RichRecSysConf trackTypeIsActive method to fix a 
    issue where the Long Track monitors in RichRecQC went missing after
    the last commit.
  . Avoid creating reconstruction sequences for track groups that would fail
    the tracking cuts (as their types are not included).
  . Forcibly set the Context correctly before anything else, in all used 
    configurables.
  . Do not append final RichPID merger to algorithm sequence if PID is 
    globally turned off.
  . Fix a small problem in the configurables that cause custom settings to
    not always be properly propagated.
  . Rework things to avoid assumptions based on the order things are applied.
  . Update the python configurable to support running with separate processing
    sequences for different track groups. Enabled by calling the method
        
        richConf = RichRecSysConf(self.richRecConfName)
        richConf.setTrackGroups( [ ["Forward","Match"],
                                   ["VeloTT"], ["KsTrack"] ] )

    Important - This *must* be done before any applyConf method is called.
    Default mode is to work as before, with all track types considered at
    the same time in the likelihood minimisation.

- In Tf/FastVelo vr19
  . Reserve vector in FastVeloFitLHCbIDs. This makes it a tiny bit faster when
    used in TrackStateInitTool.

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r40
  . Change input location of long tracks to veto in PatForward for HLT2 for 2015.
  . Make 'PatAddTTCoord' default for PatForwardTool.
  . Changes to 2015 configuration of forward tracking.
  . Add configuration for PatForward in HLT1 in 2015 to 'PatAlgConf'.
  . PatForwardTool:
    o New implementation of SecondLoop. Moved it from forwardTrack into
      tracksFromTrack and pulled out fillXList while processing SecondLoop.
      Speeds up the code by 6%, no changes in efficiency/ghost rate
    o The ranges to project hits into the reference plane now take the charge
      estimate properly into account. Speeds up the HLT1 configuration by 10%.
  . PatSeedingTool, PatSeedTool, PatSeedTrack, PatSeedFits: refactor bits of
    code to avoid code duplication; no changes in performance or timing
  . Change 'ifndef KSTRACK' to 'ifndef PATDOWNTRACK' in PatDownTrack.h to get rid
    of relics.
  . PatSeedTrack:
    o Rewrite code in constructor which calculates parabola parameters from three
      X hits (permille level increase in efficiency)
    o (very) slight code modernisation
  . Various PatSeeding classes: remove dynamic memory management by replacing
    std::vector<PatFwdHit*> with StaticArray class from DetDesc; this speeds up
    the Seeding by 4% without significant changes in performance (the code will
    now abandon track candidates which accumulate a crazy number of hits 72 or
    more, i.e. at least 6 in every layer of the T stations) 
  . PatSeedingTool/PatSeedTool/PatSeedFit: continue to push outward decision if
    hit is IT or OT (in many cases, we can now neglect to check the track
    altogether); this gains another 5 permille in speed without affecting
    results one bit
  . PatFwdTool: be a bit smarter in setting up the data structure used to
    resolve ambiguities (avoid dynamic memory management, sort only once);
    this speeds up the Forward by 2% without any change in performance
  . PatSeedTool:
	  o Add improvements made in the ambiguity resolution of the Forward:
      + keep track of quality of last ambiguity assignment, and make sure each
        hit keeps the best assignment that is possible
      + do not assign ambiguities if the pitch residual looks fishy (too large) 
      These changes speed up the Seeding by 2%, raise the efficiency by up to
      half a percent while keeping the ghost rate stable with permille level
      fluctuations.
    o Count OT hits being passed, so can call specialised variant of fit
      (this is part of an ongoing effort to push the conditional jumps out of
      the hot code path(s)); this saves about 2% CPU without affecting results
  . PatSeedFits: add template argument to select OT only, IT only, or mixed hit
    content to avoid if statements in fits

    o Fix input container for forward merging to use fitted HLT1 forward tracks
    o Fix bug with TrackStateInitTool
    o Change 'TrackListMerger' to (new) 'TrackContainerCopy', such that forward

      deprecate maxIP2PV cut, instead trackMaxChi2 is recommended
    o deprecation warning printed if the obsolete property maxIP2PV is set.
      Not removed, to avoid braking the Stripping tests in the nightlies.

- In Tr/TrackAssociators v2r12
  . Use LHCb::Track::Range such that also LHCb::Track::Selection can be used as

    GhostClassification ghost definition to TrackAssociator definition in the
    training)
  . TrackStateInitTool: Added option to use the FastMomentumEstimateTool to
    get a momentum estimate for Long tracks. This reduces the timing

    Tr/TrackUtils v1r58

- In Calo/CaloReco v5r23
  . Reconstruction.py: Corrected a typo (too few arguments to format a string)
  . CaloCorrectionBase : add boolean method to flag condition update
                         (hasConditionChanged())
  . ClusterCovarianceMatrixTool : update parameters via BeginEvent incident only
                                  when condition changed

- In Muon/MuonID v9r13
  . Speed up MuonIDAlg by a factor of 1.8 by only computing the FOI once per
    station/region/candidate momentum, and factorizing out the hit (i.e. 'dx' 
    and 'dy') dependence

- In Pr/PrAlgorithms v1r16
  . Add triangle fix in forward tracking.
  . PrSeedingXLayers:
    o Triangle Fixing implemented
    o Some hardcoded parameters put as properties

- In Pr/PrKernel v1r8
  . Add modified version of IPrCounter for efficiency studies.

- In Pr/PrMCTools v2r7
  . PrTrackAssociator: Changed output level in case the root of containers does
    not exist from ERROR to DEBUG. This reduces the output when running in Moore
    when locations not necessarily exist in each event. In the default Brunel
    configuration the default root always exists.
  . PrChecker2:
    o Modifications to be faster
    o Added TrackSelector and variable m_upgrade to change between hitLocation
      Pat/LHCbID or Pr/LHCbID for upgrade (default true).
    o Added global option to choose track extrapolation (default false).
  . Fixed fromB/fromD and isNotDown selection, added configurable track container
    for PrCounter2 and PrTTCounter, added global selection cuts: eta25cut,
    triggerNumbers, vetoElectrons.

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v9r7
  . Updated test references to follow:
    o New counter in HltFactory
    o ConfigCDBAccessSvc replaces ConfigTarFileAccessSvc
  . Added workaround for GAUDI-1007.

- In Rec/RecConf v2r20
  . Added 'pGun' to KnownSpecialData, replace normal vertex finder with
    PGPrimaryVertex when pGun is in SpecialData

- In Rich/RichGlobalPID v3r23
  . Add (yet another) new implementation of the log(exp(x)-1) function based on
    a fast linear interpolator.
  . Various other speed optimisations (avoid virtual calls etc.).

- In Rich/RichRecBase v4r19
  . Add a new method to IRichPhotonSignal to allow a client to request the
    pre-filling of all photon pixel signal information. Used to then avoid a
    virtual function call deep inside the Global PID likelihood minimisation.
  . Add protection to RichRecPhoton::expPixelSignalPhots if call with a 
    Below Threshold hypothesis.

- In Rich/RichRecMonitors v2r35
  . Add a new histogram to RichCherenkovAngleMonitor.

- In Rich/RichRecPhotonTools v1r16
  . Revert back to std::sqrt(x) instead of vdt::fast_isqrt(x) as its actually 
    faster ...
  . Turn off photon reconstruction check to reject gas photons where the
    emission point and first reflection points are on different detector sides.
  . Protect against a sqrt(-number) FPE in QuarticSolver.h
  . Update QuarticSolver to use the Complex2f class from the VectorClass library
    instead of std::complex. Results in an almost factor of two speed up of the 
    QuarticSolver::solve method...
  . Add some missing FPE protection in QuarticSolver.h
  . Replace some divisions by multiplications in QuarticSolver.h
  . Add a new test application to allow easy profiling of various implementations
    of Quartic reconstruction of photon angles.
  . Paste the code to calculate the track/pixel seperation on the PD plane
    directly into RichCKthetaBandsPhotonPredictor. Avoids a virtual call for
    every pixel+track combination, as well as avoiding a few squares when not
    required.
  . Various minor CPU optimisations (using VDT etc.).

- In Rich/RichRecSys v5r5
  . Add a new configuration option "RefitTracks" which enables a full refit of
    the tracks prior to running the RICH reconstruction on them.
  . Fix a small bug with the "PreloadTracks" options that was failing to 
    properly enable this option.

- In Rich/RichRecTools v4r27
  . Various small CPU optimisations (using VDT, prefer * to /  etc.). 

- In Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r39
  . Add a new option (enabled by default) to move states in 
    DetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks using a StateProvider using the
    stateFromTrajectory method. Faster, with no signficant loss of resolution.
  . Clean up internal interface used by DetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to
    avoid passing around unique_ptr instances by reference.
  . Add a new (off by default) option to RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to
    use a TrackTraj object move states to the RICH radiator entry and exit 
    positions.
  . Add an option to RichFunctionalCKResForRecoTracks to use the fast geometry
    when calculating the radiation length the track traverses in the RICH
    radiator volumes. Off by default.
  . Various CPU improvements (use VDT math functions etc.).

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r39
  . PatSeedingTool:
    o Be a bit smarter in hitsInRange method - saves 0.9% in CPU, same results
    o Added option to flag previously used hits with UsedLHCbIDTool.
    o Changes for running in tandem with Forward: remove the old UseForward
      property in favour of 'UsedLHCbIDToolName' property - see PAtAlgorithms
      release notes for details on how to only run over hits not used by the
      Forward. With this new flexibility, the old properties OnlyGood and
      DiscardChi2 have become obsolete, too, and have been removed.
    o Slightly modernise the code which allows "injecting" the T station
      segments of Forward tracks into the output of the Seeding (property
      'UseForwardTracks'); also add a property to limit the extraction of Forward
      tracks to those which have a minimum chi^2/ndf
  . Tuned uncertainty of point on magnetic plane in downstream tracking, change
    zMagnet parametrisation. Should slightly improve efficiency / ghost rate.
  . Tested patch which switches off the OT walk correction in the combinatorial
    stages of the Forward tracking to save even more time. Efficiencies and ghost
    rates are essentially unchanged (there are permille level fluctuations), and
    so are pulls. The Forward tracking will become about 9% faster.
  . PatSeedFit: fix bug which caused a successful stub fit to produce a warning
    and have its results ignored; having done some subversion araeology, it
    appears to be a long-standing bug in the logic of the tool. The impact on
    track parameters is negligible, though, because the stub fit is only needed
    on a small fraction of tracks, and the fit subsequently recovers by using
    the best guess parameters to start the Kalman Filter fit
  . PatSeeding and classes used by it: take advantage of the new isOT()
    method available from PatForwardHit
  . Simplify some things in PatDownTrack and PatDownstream. No performance change
  . PatMatchTool: Added the option to veto Velo seeds similar to PatForwardTool. 
  . PatForwardTool:
    o Do not add additional TT hits to Forward candidates if the Seed is an
      Upstream track. 
    o Made the location to flag Velo seeds as used a vector of locations.
      Renamed this from VeloVetoTracksName to VeloVetoTracksNames.
    o Added a protection in case the location of veto tracks does not exist.
  . PatFwdTool:
    o Use ambiguity resolution from pitch residuals by default
    o Demote an info() printout to debug(), to keep the log files clean
    o Add option to use pitch residuals to resolve ambiguities in
      the OT in a manner similar to the seeding; this results in slight
      efficiency gains (permille level), a ghost rate reduction on the percent
      level and a very marginal speedup (half a percent); see PAtAlgorithms
      release notes for details of configuration options
      The old method of resolving ambiguities remains the default for now.
  . PatForward and PatForwardTool: Moved options to flag hits and seeds from
    PatForward to PatForwardTool, such that PatForwardTool is aware of hit
    flagging. Changed the flag wich is used to flag used hits.  Removed
    option to flag Velo seeds as at this point it is not clear which Velo
    seeds should be flagged.

- In Tf/PatVeloTT v4r5
  . Add code to account for overlap hits, change default value of PassHoleSize
  . Remove a "std::cout" and clean up VeloTTHybrid.cpp/h code
    (removing obsolete members). 
  . Add some doxygen documentation.

- In Tf/TfKernel v2r30
  . SIMDChi2Fit: 
    o use UNLIKELY/LIKELY to give hints to the compiler
      (seems to improve the timing of the Seeding by about 5%)
    o add further hints to help gcc produce good autovectorised code
      This will speed up the Seeding by another 3 %.
    o Fix tiny bug which could cause the cov() method to fail in
      template parameter substitution in certain situations
  . OTHit: make use of the new walk_fast method in OTDet::WalkRelation to speed
    up Seeding and Forward by about 4%; effects on efficiencies, ghost rates,
    pulls and so on are on the permille level

- In Tf/TrackSys v9r5
  . Add GhostProbability to RecoUpgradeTracking.py
  . Adapt RecoTracking.py, such that for data type '2015' PatVeloTTHybrid instead
    of PatVeloTT is run. The (internal) Kalman filter is off per default.

- In Tr/TrackExtrapolators v2r36
  . TrackRungeKuttaExtrapolator: replace std::pow(x, 0.25) by
    std::sqrt(std::sqrt(x)) because it's faster, tidy up in a few places; this
    makes the extrapolator 2% faster without changing the results significantly
  . Extrapolators: make static magic numbers 'const'

- In Tr/TrackFitter v5r3
  . Reserve space in vector of matrial intersections, so we don't have to
    reallocate quite as frequently; this does not change results

- In Tr/TrackInterfaces v4r28
  . Extended IGhostProbability to ease up development
  . Different interfaces for GhostProbability and TrackLikelihood (incident
    handle doesn't do the job)

- In Tr/TrackKernel v2r2
  . Replace use of ROOT::Math::Similarity with new faster vectorised
    LHCb::Math::Similarity in CubicStateInterpolationTraj.

- In Tr/TrackMCTools v3r11p1
  . Remove unnecessary PhysEvent includes from PGPrimaryVertex.h and remove
    PhysEvent dependency that they introduced

- In Tr/TrackMonitors v2r5
  . Add the histograms needed for online OT T0 calibration to the histograms
    produced online.

- In Tr/TrackProjectors v3r2
  . TrajOTProjector:
    o Remove superfluous dynamic_cast, speedup about 6%
    o Update for upcoming changes to RtRelation class by being more flexible in
      terms of data type returned by RtRelation's methods

- In Tr/TrackTools v5r7
  . TrackUsedLHCbIDs:
    o Make hit lookup O(1) instead of O(ln(Nhits)) by using BloomFilters - see
      TrackTools release notes for assumptions made in the implementation. When
      used offline to run Seeding only on hits not used by Forward tracks, this
      reduces the time to look if a hit was used by the Forward by 36%
    o  Changed LHCb::Tracks* to LHCb::Track::Range
  . VeloClusterPositionTool: various little fixes to speed things up
    o don't create std::vector on the fly every time cluster->channels() is
      called, fill an std::array of sufficient size instead
    o don't dynamic_cast when a static_cast will do
    o use vdt::fast_... versions of various trigonometric functions (they're
      more than accurate enough not to affect Velo performance in any way) 
  . Speed up StateThickMSCorrectionTool by a factor two
  . Speed up StateDetailedBetheBlochEnergyCorrectionTool by a factor two
    o caching particle masses more agressively
    o aggressive caching of material-related quatities and calculations (this
      will save quite a few virtual function calls and a log at runtime)
    o use of vdt to implement pow(x, y)
  . Remove include "FTRawCluster" in UpgradeGhostID.cpp
  . Ghost Probability for Run2.
    o Cleaner code, removed time consuming inputs, newly trained to work with new
      reconstruction and expected 2015 conditions, NN implementation speed up.
    o Foreseen to remove TrackNNGhostId and corresponding network trainings
    o Adapt to updated IGhostProbability interface
  . Swapped StatusCodes in UpgradeGhostInfo::countHits
  . Improved hit counting in UpgradeGhostInfo
  . Minor code cosmetics on VeloMuonBuild

- In Tr/TrackUtils v1r58
  . TrackListRefiner: Prevented algorithm from creating a new location in case
    the input location does not exist.
  . Changed interface for TrackAddNNGhostId

    Bs2MuMu development tunings.
  . Remove the out of 0-1 bounds checks for TMVA networks. Not needed for MLP
    MVAs, and breaks with BDTs which vary from -1 to 1 ...
  . Check the 'error' return values from ChargedProtoANNPIDTool to
    -3 : Invalid ProtoParticle or track
    -2 : Failed pre-selection cuts.
    Done in order to avoid using -1, as this is a valid BDT return value.
  . Add new developmental PID tunings for Bs2MuMu.

- In Rec/GlobalReco v6r52
  . NeutralProtoPAlg : reduce verbosity

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v9r5, v9r6
  . Update unittests (and example jobs) to use latest database tag
  . Small correction in jobs/gaudipython_mu_calculation.py
  . Check for *DST types rather than explicit DST names in LumiAlgs config

    and from pre 2010 treatment of primary vertex
  . Remove 'TrackMatching' and 'TrackSeeding' from dependencies
  . Remove obsolete RDST special case

- In Rec/RecInterfaces v1r4
  . Change default return value in IChargedProtoANNPIDTool to -3

    return value.

- In Rich/RichGlobalPID v3r22
  . Fix an unprotected debug

- In Rich/RichRecBase v4r18
  . Removed unused dictionary selection rules.

- In Rich/RichRecQC v2r68
  . Adapt to split HLT setup

- In Tf/FastVelo v1r17
  . Added a rejection for too many tracks using the same phi clusters

 - In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r37
   . PatFwdTrackCondidate:
     o use vdt::fast_isqrt 
     o move data members to the 'top' of the class so that one can use 'auto'
       (trailing) return specifitation
     o improve PatFwdTrackCandidate memory layout: move 'cold' pointer towards
       the 'back'
   . PatFwdTool:
     o speed up distanceForFit, simplify inline methods
     o better use of ranges
   . PatForward uses Ranges now to access track selections as well as containers
   . PatForwardTool: small speedup in fillXList, cleanup
   . PatFwdPlaneCounter: add addHitwWhile
   . PatDownstream:
     o fix such that hits in at least three layers are required for a track.
     o avoid interrogating the MagneticFieldSvc at every track to get the
       signedRelativeCurrent, once per event is enough!
   . New implementation of the search for compatible hits in PatAddTTCoord.
     Faster, but efficiency performance should be stable.
   . PatSeedingTool: modernise some of the code somewhat; no functional changes,
     no changes in performance or timing

- In Tf/PatVeloTT v4r3
  . PatVeloTTHybrid uses Ranges now. It can operate on both track containers 
    and track selections
  . Optimised PatVeloTTHybridTool for low momentum tracks

- In Tf/TfKernel v2r28
  . Reverted work around for spurious entries in the rootmap files.
  . Tf::TStationHitManager: replace the ToolHandle instances by ordinary
    pointers to the interfaces implemented by the tools.
  . SIMDChi2Fit.h: fix warning about extra semicolon

- In Tf/TrackSys v9r3
  . Replace "Match" with "PatMatch" for old sequence of PatReco algorithms in
    Configuration.py
  . Remove 'TrackMatching' from RecoTracking.py. A runtime error is raised 
    if it is set as a track type.
  . Remove 'TrackMatching' and 'TrackSeeding' from dependencies

- In Tr/TrackCheckers v4r21
  . Remove 'TrackMatchChecker', as 'TrackMatching' was put in 'obsolete'

- In Tr/TrackFitEvent v6r4
  . FitNode.cpp: remove unused function ::transportVector to
                 silence gcc49 warning
  . Small change to OTMeasurement to make sure it also works for trajectories
    other than LineTraj

- In Tr/TrackInterfaces v4r27
  . Remove two virtual functions in IAddTTClusterTool, as AddTTClusterTool is not
    in Rec anymore and they are not needed.

- In Tr/TrackKernel v2r1
  . Rewrite TrackCloneData class:
    o use Bloom filter to quickly check for non-overlapping tracks (use old
      method to determine size of overlap if overlap might be non-emptr); this
      option will give exactly the same result as previous code in all cases
      (default)
    o option to do the entire overlap calculation with size estimate of Bloom
      filter class - slightly faster, but will cause permille level differences
      (selectable with template argument, but not default)
    o template argument to allow choice between owning the contained pointer
      to the underlying track (default) or not owning it

- In Tr/TrackMCTools v3r11
  . Add wrapper for ghost track classification tools to decide on a
    track-by-track base which implementation to use

- In Tr/TrackTools v5r5
  . Use vdt::fast_log to speed up hotspots
  . Make sure the cluster size is always set in VeloClusterPosition

- In Tr/TrackUtils v1r57
  . Added counters to TrackListRefiner
  . TrackBestTrackCreator: use the ancestor information to get rid of obvious
    clones early in the process (as is done in TrackEventCloneKiller), this
    speeds up the algorithm by about 3.5%, and gets rid of a couple of
    problematic tracks in T and the Velo before they're fitted (without
    adversely affecting performance - these tracks usually got killed by the
    chi^2 cut inside TrackBestTrackCreator after the fit); the number of tracks
    in the Best container stays unchanged; the new UseAncestorInfo property can
    be used to restore the old behaviour if needed
  . Factor out the remove_if_partitioned algorithm from TrackEventCloneKiller
    and TrackBestTrackCreator, and move it to its own header file; adapt
    TrackEventCloneKiller and TrackBestTrackCreator accordingly   
  . TrackEventCloneKiller: rewrite internal logic so fewer comparisons are
    needed to determine if two tracks are clones, use Bloom filters for
    non-overlapping tracks, remove useless (and unused) StoreCloneTrack
    property from algorithm; efficiency and ghost rate changes are at the
    permille level, and the algorithm should be 7-15% faster now
  . Rewrite TrackBestTrackCreator to take advantage of the Bloom filters in
    TrackCloneData from TrKernel; also modernise and clarify the code somewhat
    (C++11, consistent use of generic algorithms where possible)
  . Remove 'TrackMatching' from 'TrackFromDST'
  . Remove 'TrackSeeding' from 'TrackFromDST' and 'TTrackFromLong'

- In Velo/VeloRecMonitors v2r30
  . Fix the check in case of no MC hit association in VeloTrackMonitorNT

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v17r2p1>2014-10-22 RecSys v17r2p1</A></H1><PRE>
This version uses Gaudi v25r4p1, LHCb v38r2p1 and Lbcom v16r1p1 (and ROOT 6.02.01)

Identical to v17r2 but built against LCG_70root6 with ROOT 6.02.01

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v17r2>2014-10-22 RecSys v17r2</A></H1><PRE>
This version uses Gaudi v25r4, LHCb v38r2 and Lbcom v16r1 (and ROOT v5.43.21)

    Rec/LumiAlgs v9r5, Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r36, Tf/TfKernel v2r27,
    Tf/TfTools v1r19, Tr/TrackMCTools v3r10p1, Tr/TrackUtils v1r56

- In Muon/MuonTrackRec v3r12
  . MuonCombRec: Make tools public, protect debug statements, some 
                 simplifications in the code.
  . MuonHitDecode: Introduce option to skip the calculations of the
    'hardware numbers', as it is not needed for pure track reconstruction

- In Pr/PrKernel v1r5, Pr/PrPixel v1r10, TfKernel v2r27
  . Save 1/error in hit class instead of 1/error^2; this should facilitate
    exploiting hit-level parallelism in chi^2 fits in the pattern reco; client
    code should run correctly without modification (and without appreciable
    change in performance). See reasoning in TfKernel release notes

- In Pr/PrMCTools v2r4p1
  . Add some more doxygen comments to PrPlotFTHits.

- In Rec/GlobalReco v6r51
  . Add some additional debug messages.
  . Adaption for recent ROOT version and minor modifications to plotting 
    PID-curves.

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v9r5
  . Check for *DST types rather than explicit DST names in LumiAlgs config

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r36
  . Use the new SIMDChi2Fit framework for the seeding; efficiencies and ghost
    rates are stable at the permille level, timing is unaffected within the
    usual 5% fluctuations I see on my system
  . PatFwdFitParabola: reduce the # of multiplications needed. This slightly 
    changes the rounding, which affects the results at the 1e-5 level.
  . PatFwdRegionCounter, PatForwardTool: replace some for loops with 
    std::for_each, more use of auto, improve formatting
  . PatFwdTool: 
    o Make updateHitsForTrack a standalone function, factor out the fit in the Y
      projection, inline zMagnet, upgrade inRegion check from lambda to functor
    o Factor out search for 'best region' and 'shortest range',
      move towards providing a 'const' interface, use boost::iterator_range
    o Change max_projected_element to return the iterator pointing
      at the max element instead of the max element itself.
  . PatFwdTool, PatForwardTool: replace (allmost) all double with auto, to make
    it easier to see how  a single precision version would work at a later time.
  . PatForwardTool:
    o Use boost::iterator_range, reduce triple nesting in loop over
      station/layer/region to a single loop. Fix off-by-one bug
    o Use specialized update{OT,NonOT}HitForTrack to avoid branches in innermost
      loop
  . PatForward: make acceptTrack const
  . PatFwdTool:setRLDefault: simplify enough so the compiler inlines
    the RLAmbiguityResolver completely

- In Tf/TfKernel v2r27
  . Include new header SIMDChi2Fit.h, a fully customisable chi^2 track fit for
    use inside pattern recognition algorithms which can (to some degree)
    exploit the parallelism inherent in simultaneously working on several hits
    using autovectorisation in selected bits of code
  . Moved Tf::IStationSelector (C++11-free) to an independent header (it is the
    only class needed in the dictionary).
  . Add specialized updateXYZHitsForTrack without any branches
  . Reduce code duplication by having the above return the computed y coordinate,
    which allows daisy chaining the OT version.

- In Tf/TfTools v1r19
  . Improve auto usage
  . More C++11-ification in {OT,ST}HitCreator and HitCreatorGeom
  . Take advantage of C++11 in OTHitCreator -- according to callgrind, this
    results in a 10% relative CPU gain

- In Tr/TrackMCTools v3r10p1
  . Add missing PhysEvent dependency in CMakeLists.txt 

- In Tr/TrackUtils v1r56
  . TrackEventCloneKiller uses LHCb::Track::Range now. This allows it to run
    on selections as well as containers.

    Tr/TrackFitter v5r2, Tr/TackMCTools v3r10, Tr/TrackMonitors v2r4,
    Tr/TrackTools v5r4

- In Calo/CaloPIDs v5r19
  . CaloElectronMatch, CaloBremMatch.cpp, CaloPhotonMatch.cpp :
    decrease verbosity of tolerable errors to WARNING
  . CaloElectronMatch : extrapolate the track to the CaloHypo Z position instead
                        of ZShowerMax plane

- In Calo/CaloReco v5r21, v5r21p1
  . CaloMergedPi0 : fix bug that affect sub-seed definition in some configuration 
 	. Configuration.py : decrease MergedPi0Pt threshold from 2 GeV to 1.5 GeV
   (applies on cluster pT before merged hypothesis is fully reconstructed)
  . Various CPU performance improvements.
  . CaloECorrection.cpp, CaloSCorrection.cpp : correct defaults for missing
    correction functions in CondDB and add more protection
  . CaloCorrectionBase/CaloECorrection/CaloSCorrection : implement correction
    propagation to Covariance

- In Calo/CaloTools v6r10
  . CaloHypoEstimator.cpp : implement ClusterCode & ClusterFrac 

- In Pr/PrAlgorithms v1r14
  . Removed unused Kalman Fitter tool in PrDownstream.h
  . Added several improvements to PrDownstream - can be switched on with the
    option PrDownstream().Mode = False ; the new approach includes
    1) Vetoing of Seeds that share FT hits with reasonably good ForwardTracks
    2) Building several track candidates and fiting them separately instead of
    putting all uv hits on one candidate and doing outlier removal
    3) Keeping more than one candidate per seed if we can't decide which one is
    the best in terms of chi2
  . By default the old algorithm should run
  . Add Doxygen comments

- In Pr/PrMCTools v2r4
  . Make Best track location configurable in PrChecker

- In Pr/PrPixel v1r9
  . Type conversion carried over most of the code from double to single
    floating point precision.
  . PrPixelTrack fit and covariance functions coded in SSE / SSE2 intrinsics.

- In Rec/GlobalReco v6r49, v6r50
  . ChargedProtoParticleMaker : If output already exists clear and reuse.
  . NeutralProtoPAlg : 
    o Change default value to +1 for IsPhoton when variable is not evaluated
      (i.e. pt<2GeV hence not merged)
    o add ClusterCode & ClusterFrac as extra info

- In Rec/RecAlgs v3r2
  . Replace 'Other/RawEvent' with 'Calo/RawEvent' in default RecInit.cpp 
    search list, for forward compatibility with RawEvent format 4.0

- In Rec/RecConf v2r18
  . Add 'SkipTracking' slot to RecSysConf and RecMoniConf. If enabled, tracking
    sequences are skipped. Used by Brunel to reprocess from DST without 
    rerunning the tracking 

- In Rich/RichRecQC v2r67
  . Remove Aerogel from default radiator list when DataType is set for Run II.
  . Clean up RichHPDHitsMoni with some C++11 syntax.

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r34, v4r35
  . Make PatForwardTool so that it only exposes 'const' methods.
  . PatFwdTool: tweak RL ambiguity resolution code so that it can be const
  . PatSeedingTool, PatSeedTrack: use a Bloom filter to quickly detect tracks
    which have no overlap in hits after xz search. See PatAlgorithms release
    notes for discussion of performance improvements this brings
  . PatSeedingTool: properties CloneMaxXDistIT and CloneMaxXDistOT are obsolete
    now (BloomFilter is more reliable and faster)
  . Unify scalar and vector version of PatFwdTool::xAtReferencePlane_ by using
    variadic templates to gather/scatter the vectors to generate both scalar and
    vector versions from the same source, based on the number of arguments. 
    This produces optimal code for both cases (i.e. fully inlined, no extra 
    function calls) without having to write a lot of overloads and/or
    specializations of the gather/scatter operations. 
  . Generalize the vectorization types 
  . Unify the with/without B-field versions of PatFwdTool::xAtReferencePlane
  . Move the skipping of used hits from PatForwardTool to PatForward. This avoids
    having to look up all hits for all seeds, and instead does it once per event.
  . Tweak some inline methods a bit...
  . Further optimize PatForwardTool:fillXList
  . Ensure that when using PatForwardTool directly, i.e. not from PatForward,
    that PatTStationHitManager::prepareHits() is invoked. Without this call, the
    'hasNext' and 'hasPrevious' information on PatForwardHits is missing (see
    PatAlgorithms release.notes for effect of this)
  . Make PatFwdCandidate 'vector friendly' i.e. don't enforce types on a few
    member functions that perform arithmetic.
  . Update PatFwdTool to use the above, and make it more 'type neutral' as well.
  . Added a few useful counters to PatForwardTool 
  . Added TrackUsedLHCbID tool to PatForwardTool: allows to exclude hits that
    have already been used elsewhere
  . Make the skipping of used seed tracks optional in PatForwardTool
    default: do not skip (false) can be switched on through property skipUsedSeeds
  . Provide, and use vector, interface version of PatFwdTool::xAtReference, 
    PatFwdTool::setXAtReference
    o Update PatForwardTool to use above vector interface (changes results at the
      permille level as x boundaries are now treated left-right symmetrically)
    o Implement an explicitly vectorized (using gcc vector extension, see
      https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html; note that clang
      supports these as well: 
      http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#vectors-and-extended-vectors), 
      branch-free version of PatFwdTool::xAtReference, 
      and use it in PatFwdTool::setXAtReference
    o Enable vectorization only when using gcc...  icc and clang don't (yet)
      support all of the extensions used for this.
  . Fix clang brace warnings

 - In Tf/TfKernel v2r26
   . add a 'hitsInXRange' method to TStationHitManager (i.e. both lower and upper
     bound)
  . Extend OTHit such that is possible to get the driftTime _without_ the 
    (expensive) walk correction. And in the OTHit constructor, which ask for 
    driftTime at the middle of the station, ensure it skips the walk correction
  . Add a method in RecoFuncs which allows one to update the hits without
    doing the walk correction. 
  . Replace size_t by int to specify layer/station/region -- int more than large
    enough to enumerate them, and int division is faster than size_t division.

- In Tf/TrackSys v9r2
  . Use standard tracking sequence also for 2010 data. Previously was using
    TsaSeed instead of PatSeed and non-standard GECs
  . In RecoTracking.py, factor out the RAW bank decoding into a separate
    RecoTracking.DecodeTracking(), so it can be called independently, to just
    decode the Raw banks without running the tracking sequences.

- In Tr/TrackExtrapolators v2r34
  . Fix memory leak in TrackStateProvider::finalize

- In Tr/TrackFitEvent v6r3
  . Added method to KalmanFitResult to count number of active hits of given type
  . Fixed (inconsequential) bug in FitNode smoother

- In Tr/TrackFitter v5r2
  . Added functionality to TrackMasterFitter to _not_ set scattering momentum for
    velo-only tracks
  . Hide counters in TrackEventFitter behind msgLevel(INFO) to save time

- In Tf/TrackMCTools v3r10
  . Add PGPrimaryVertex

- In Tr/TrackMonitors v2r4
  . Improve the FPE protection in AlignmentOnlineMonitor

- In Tr/TrackTools v5r4
  . Make TrackVelodEdxCharge capable of running on tracks without measurements

  . CaloShowerOverlapTool : new tool to substract overlap energy in cluster pair
    (note : CaloSharedCellAlg.cpp is now obsolete)
  . CaloMergedPi0 & CaloShowerOverlap  : mergePi0 reconstruction and 
    ClusterOverlap based on the above tool (CaloMergedPi0Alg is now obsolete)
  . Adapt to change in cluster masking : CaloClusterizationTool, 
    SubClusterSelectorBase, CaloClusterCovarianceAlg, SubClusterSelector3x3,

  . CaloCorrectionBase  : map new corrections and implement generic DB access for
    cluster masks

    but only when requested explicitly (PrPixelTrack::fit).
  . Use auto iterators.

- In Rec/ChargedProtoANNPID v2r7
  . Add support for a new MC12TuneV3 network tune. 
    Default for now is still MC12TuneV2.
  . Add a new tool that provides access to the ANNPID for a given ProtoParticle.

- In Rec/GlobalReco v6r48

  . NeutralProtoParticleAddNeutralID.{cpp,h} : new algorithm to re-evaluate the
    NN-based neutralID directly using protoP info (to be used in DV)

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v9r4
  . Expose ILumiIntegrator interface to python 
    This makes it possible to get lumi and mu values per run in gaudipython job.
  . Add example for gaudipython usage of mu calculation in jobs directory

- In Rec/RecInterfaces v1r3
  . Add a new tool interface that provides access to the ANNPID variables.

- In Rich/RichHPDImageAnalysis v1r14
  . Removed duplicate dictionary entries.

- In Rich/RichRecSys v5r3
  . Disable Aerogel for Run II DataTypes (2015 onwards).

- In Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r37
  . Retire the (incomplete and never used) class
    RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracksStateProvider.
  . Extend the class RichDetailedTrSegMakerFromRecoTracks to dynamically use an
    instance of the TrackStateProvider tool to create missing track states as
    needed. Restores the ability of the RICH reconstruction to run in tracks
    saved to DSTs, which was broken when the DST format was updated to purge
    the tracks of states not needed downstream.

- In Tf/PatKernel v2r7
  . Improve memory layout of PatFwdHit

- In Tf/PatVelo v3r31
  . Prevent FPE when refitting a cheated PR track

  . replace hitpointer containers and bool arrays in UT station manager
  . replace 3D,2D and 1D arrays of bool with a dedicated bit array
  . Strip spurious entry from the rootmap (ROOT 6 problem).
  . Change hitpointer container layout in T and TT station managers: replace
    3D,2D and 1D arrays of vectors by single vector + arrays of indices.
    This improves timing of eg. PatForward by something in between 5% and 10%.
  . Fix off-by-one beyond-bounds bug when zero-ing the indices (identified
    very clearly by clang!)

- In Tr/TrackFitEvent v6r2
  . VPMeasurement: modify constructor, passing PixelPositionInfo directly 
    instead of cluster position tool.

  . Replace separate exist<>() + get<>() calls with getIfExists
  . Fix trivial icc remarks
  . Introduced IP chi2 in TrackV0Monitor after loosening it in TrackV0Finder.
    This should take care that online monitoring will not suddenly see much
    dirtier Ks list.

- In MuonPIDChecker v5r3
  . Added protection when retrieving MuonPID and Muon track containers

- In GlobalReco v6r42
  . Change default track chi^2 cut from 0->10 to 0->5, to reflect tracking
    changes. Note that by default in the tracking clone killing a cut of 0->3 is
    now applied, so this cut does nothing. Retain though as a sanity check.

    keep just for sanity check.
  . Improve the way the track types are set, to fix a bug in the HLT where the
    requested track types to use was not always respected.

- In FastVelo v1r8, v1r9
  . Added a ProcStatus when clone killing fired to make monitoring easier
  . Added a sanity check just before conversion to LHCb::Tracks that if there is
    more than 1 track for every 4 clusters the event should be very aggressivly
    clone killed (default only 10% overlap allowed). To fix cases of off axis
    beam backgrounds causing a combinatoric explosion in the number of VELO
    tracks made and subsequent processing time. See Savannah bug #93550.

- In PatAlgorithms v4r21, v4r22, v4r23
  . PatMatchTool : Momentum estimate now protected against failure.
  . PatMatchTool, PatDownstream : Added option MinMomentum and MinPt
    to reject tracks with a certain momentum.
  . PatMatchTool: Make the name of the tool that adds the TT hits a property

    forward tracking in PatDownstream. Now used seeds and tt hits can be removed
    also in the HLT.

    o Output is ASCII file with name specified by OutputFileName option.
      For each event in input with nonzero random counter a line with ODIN
      fields and lumi counters is written. Events are not time-ordered!
  . Add minimal DumpLumiEvents.py job options
  . Add QM test dumplumievent.qmt
  . Fix warnings due to unused code

- In RecAlgs v2r7
  . Adapt RecInit to removal of random seeds from ProcessHeader

- In FastPV v1r0p1
  . Remove unused variable in TrackForPV.h, fixes UNINIT_CTOR Coverity warning

- In PatAlgorithms v4r20
  . PatForwardTool: Bug fix in PatForward in part which uses momentum estimate.
    Variable was shadowed, resulting in wrong behaviour of the algorithm.

- In PatVeloTT v3r18
  . Change PatVTTTrack so that debug stream created only when needed

  Development release for Stripping 18 test

- Packages updated: Calo/CaloReco v5r14, Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r6,
    Rec/LumiAlgs v7r4, Rich/RichRecQC v2r57, Tf/FastVelo v1r7,

    Tr/PatPV v3r22

- In Calo/CaloReco v5r14
  . CaloMergedPi0Alg: Fix potential memory leak, probably never fired
    (Coverity defect 17572)
  . Fix UNINIT_CTOR defects
  . Fix trivial icc remarks

- In Muon/MuonTrackMonitor v2r6
  . remove line that sets "NodeFitter.BiDirectionalFit" in configuration

- In Rec/LumiAlgs v7r4
  . Slightly more informative warning message for missing FSR data
  . Introduce option IgnoreDQFlags, gived warning when set
  . Introduce logic in LumiIntegrateFSR to skip integration based on DQflags
  . Update unit tests
  . Make explicit that FilterFillingScheme is not used before 2011
  . Add protection for data beyond 2012, requiring explicit update
  . Initialize 2012 behaviour with safest possible condition
  . Fix bug with minor effect (1E-4) in LumiIntegrateFSR
  . Add missing dependencies for tests, following reorganisation of GaudiConf
  . Remove imports from GaudiConf

- In Rich/RichRecQC v2r57
  . Added sequence control in RichHPDFlashMoni

- In Tf/FastVelo v1r7
  . Improve for large IP tracks:
    o Allow change of zone in RZ tracks, but at least 3 in the same zone
      Remove the test that all R hits should be in the same zone later...
    o Count the total cluster size. If average > 1.9, allow tracks with
      higher quality factor (+1.0) (i.e. when two tracks overlap in RZ)
    o Reduce the deltaPhi tolerance for backward tracks (speed)
  . Use the new 'wasDecoded' flag of the Velo sensor to count missed sensors.
  . Reserve space in vectors. (Feed back from Sasha Mazuroz's talk on 6/2/2012)
  . Copy vectors using the insert method.-> -4% time.

- In Tf/PatAlgorithms v4r18
  . PatDownstream: make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit
    in HLT
  . PatForwardTool: 
    o Changed parametrisation of first search window in x.
      Required to add property "MagnetKickParams" to PatForwardTool.
    o Bug fix in PatForward in part which uses momentum estimate.
  . PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool:
    o Fixed part which uses momentum estimate. This part of the code was not used
      anywhere or if it was used it could not work.
    o Removed property "RangeErrorFraction" and changed default value of
      "MinRange". To make sure that the user knows that a momentum estimate is
      used, added property "UseMomentumEstimate" which is false by default.
  . Change calls to std::sort where hits were sorted by a potentially unstable
    sorting criterium to use std::stable_sort; the reason is that there is a
    possibility that we end up with more than one hit at the same z (e.g. two
    hits in same layer), so the result of the sort will depend on the
    implementation of std::sort - using std::stable_sort instead avoids that
    (these changes have to be applied in addition to those in Tf/TfKernel to
    fix differences observed between gcc 4.3 and gcc 4.6)
  . PatFwdTrackCandidate: avoid some memory allocations in handling the vector
    of PatFwdHits
  . FastForwardTool, PatAddTTCoord: replace std::vector by boost::array to avoid
    memory allocations
  . PatDownTrack: avoid needless copying of parameter vectors, preallocate
    space for hit container
  . work on const correctness (where possible)

- In Tf/TrackSys v7r1
  . Fix a bug in python/TrackSys/PatChecking.py which causes the
    TrackEffChecker not to be run on Velo tracks if FastVelo is used
  . Remove unnecessary import from RecoTracking.py

- In Tr/TrackFitEvent v5r14
  . Adapt KalmanFitResult and FitNode to change in Measurement
  . Improve speed of FitNode::computeFilteredState

- In Tr/TrackFitter v4r4
  . Changes to revive functionality of 'forward only' fit
  . Increased minimum number of hits left in outlier removal
  . Small improvement in MasterFitter::outlierRemoved to call smoothing less
    often (only affects HLT)
  . Fix in TrackKalmanFilter to make profiling easier

- In Tr/TrackMonitors v1r37
  . Extend range of histogram for 'Track:history' flag such that we can actually
    see FastVelo

- In Tr/TrackTools v4r12
  . Several changes to TrackStateInitTool to get better track initialization
  . Use Warning(...) instead of warning() << for messages in MuonTTTrack, so
    they eventually get suppressed, and move some info() to debug()
    (for stripping).

- In Tr/PatPV v3r22
  . Remove usage of WeigthsVector from PatPV
  . Make LSAdaptPV3DFitter faster (for HLT)
  . Update PatPVOffline to no longer create a separate 'WeightsVector', but
    instead to store the track weights directly in the RecVertex class, which
    now supports this.
  . Update PVOfflineRecalculate to take the track weights direct from the PV
    itself, instead of trying to load the now obsolete weights vector.

    o Make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit in HLT
    o Clean up and streamline the code somewhat while we're at it;
      one minor change in behaviour: if momentum estimate tool fails (as far as I
      can see, the current implementation cannot fail), we don't touch the
      momentum estimates of states on a newly created track, we rely on the
      algorithms which supply these tracks to do something reasonable in that
      case
  . include somewhat more fine-grained timing measurements in PatSeedingTool for
    the initial x search (not active by default)
  . for trigger use, add the NDblOTHitsInXSearch property which cuts on the
    number of double hits in the OT (i.e. hits in two monolayers of the same
    layer) for the three layers which are used to form the initial search
    parabola if that number is lower then NDblOTHitsInXSearch, the candidate is
    abandoned early
    The default value for the new property is 0, so the default behaviour does
    not change, however, putting 2 there in the trigger saved O(20%) execution
    time while only 0.5-1% of efficiency is lost (all momenta, for p > 5GeV, the
    efficiency loss is on the order of 0.1-0.3%)

- In PatPV v3r21
  . Introduce beamspot constraint into PVSeedTool to make PatPV3D faster which
    gives a factor between 2 or 3 in exe time when switching from 3D PVSeed3DTool
    to PVSeedTool, lower false PV rate and lower PV->SV mistakes, same
    performance for other parameters like resolution and PV efficiency

- In VeloRecMonitors v2r17
  . Added new plot for "high multiplicity, # clusters", with logic to get
    cluster multiplicity from raw event
  . Increased upper bin limit on the default "# VELO clusters" plot to 6000
