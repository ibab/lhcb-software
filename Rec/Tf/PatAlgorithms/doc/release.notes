! 2015-03-30 - Marian Stahl
  - release.notes: Didn't enter release note for my commit on 2015-03-27

! 2015-03-29 - Michel De Cian
 - Add configuration for PatForward in HLT1 in 2015 to 'PatAlgConf'.

! 2015-03-27 - Marian Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: New implementation of SecondLoop.
   Moved it from forwardTrack into tracksFromTrack and pulled out
   fillXList while processing SecondLoop. Speeds up the code by 6%, 
   no changes in efficiency/ghost rate

! 2015-03-23 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: The ranges to project hits into the reference plane take
   now the charge estimate properly into account. This speeds up the HLT1
   configuration by 10%.

! 2015-03-03 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTrack: (very) slight code modernisation
 - PatSeedTool: clean up further

! 2015-03-02 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool, PatSeedTool, PatSeedTrack, PatSeedFits: refactor bits of
   code to avoid code duplication; no changes in performance or timing

! 2015-03-02 - Michel De Cian
 - Change 'ifndef KSTRACK' to 'ifndef PATDOWNTRACK' in PatDownTrack.h to get rid of relics.

! 2015-02-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTrack: rewrite code in constructor which calculates parabola
   parameters from three X hits (permille level increase in efficiency)
 - various PatSeeding classes: remove dynamic memory management by replacing
   std::vector<PatFwdHit*> with StaticArray class from DetDesc; this speeds up
   the Seeding by 4% without significant changes in performance (the code will
   now abandon track candidates which accumulate a crazy number of hits 72 or
   more, i.e. at least 6 in every layer of the T stations) 

! 2015-02-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool/PatSeedTool/PatSeedFit: continue to push outward decision if
   hit is IT or OT (in many cases, we can now neglect to check the track
   altogether); this gains another 5 permille in speed without affecting
   results one bit

! 2015-02-28 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdTool: be a bit smarter in setting up the data structure used to
   resolve ambiguities (avoid dynamic memory management, sort only once);
   this speeds up the Forward by 2% without any change in performance

! 2015-02-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool: add improvements made in the ambiguity resolution of the
   Forward:
   - keep track of quality of last ambiguity assignment, and make sure each
     hit keeps the best assignment that is possible
   - do not assign ambiguities if the pitch residual looks fishy (too large) 
   These changes speed up the Seeding by 2%, raise the efficiency by up to
   half a percent while keeping the ghost rate stable with permille level
   fluctuations.

! 2015-02-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedFits: add template argument to select OT only, IT only, or mixed hit
   content to avoid if statements in fits
 - PatSeedTool: count OT hits being passed, so can call specialised variant of
   fit (this is part of an ongoing effort to push the conditional jumps out of
   the hot code path(s)); this saves about 2% CPU without affecting results

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r39 2015-02-23 =========================
! 2015-02-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: be a bit smarter in hitsInRange method - saves 0.9% in CPU,
   same results

! 2015-02-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool changes for running in tandem with Forward:
   - remove the old UseForward property in favour of Sascha's clearly superior
     'UsedLHCbIDToolName' property; to only run over hits not used by the
     Forward, use these options:

     from Configurables import PatSeeding, PatSeedingTool, TrackUsedLHCbID
     seeding = PatSeeding('PatSeedingTool')
     seeding.addTool(PatSeedingTool, name = 'PatSeedingTool')
     seeding.PatSeedingTool.addTool(TrackUsedLHCbID, name = 'TrackUsedLHCbID')
     seeding.PatSeedingTool.UsedLHCbIDToolName = 'TrackUsedLHCbID'
     seeding.PatSeedingTool.TrackUsedLHCbID.inputContainers = [
         'location/of/good/forward/tracks/on/the/TES', ... ]
     
     With this new flexibility, the old properties OnlyGood and DiscardChi2
     have become obsolete, too, and have been removed. The functionality can
     be duplicated with the 'selectorNames' property of the TrackUsedLHCbID
     tool.

   - slightly modernise the code which allows "injecting" the T station
     segments of Forward tracks into the output of the Seeding (property
     'UseForwardTracks'); the main application for this is specialised
     studies; also add a property to limit the extraction of Forward tracks to
     those which have a minimum chi^2/ndf
   
   These changes do not affect performance or timing in the default
   configuration of the Seeding. 

! 2015-02-19 - Michel De Cian
 - Tuned uncertainty of point on magnetic plane in downstream tracking, change zMagnet parametrisation. 
  Should slightly improve efficiency / ghost rate.

! 2015-02-16 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - Tested patch by Gerhard Raven which switches off the OT walk correction in
   the combinatorial stages of the Forward tracking to save even more time.
   The impact of this was verified on MC with the same method the approximated
   walk correction was verified in last week's Tracking and Alignment meeting.
   Efficiencies and ghost rates are essentially unchanged (there are permille
   level fluctuations), and so are pulls. The Forward tracking will become
   about 9% faster.

! 2015-02-15 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdTool: protect debug() printout
 - PatSeedFit: fix bug which caused a successful stub fit to produce a warning
   and have its results ignored; having done some subversion araeology, it
   appears to be a long-standing bug in the logic of the tool. the impact on
   track parameters is negligible, though, because the stub fit is only needed
   on a small fraction of tracks, and the fit subsequently recovers by using
   the best guess parameters to start the Kalman Filter fit

! 2015-02-09 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: Added a protection in case the location of veto tracks does not exist.

! 2015-02-05 - Michel De Cian
 - Simplify some things in PatDownTrack and PatDownstream. No performance changes.

! 2015-02-04 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatMatchTool: Added the option to veto Velo seeds similar to PatForwardTool. 
 - PatForwardTool: Do not add additional TT hits to Forward candidates if the
   Seed is an Upstream track. 

! 2015-01-29 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatSeedingTool: Added option to flag previously used hits with UsedLHCbIDTool.
 - PatForwardTool: Made the location to flag Velo seeds as used a vector of locations.
   Renamed this from VeloVetoTracksName to VeloVetoTracksNames.

! 2015-01-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdTool: following decision in today's tracking meeting, use ambiguity
   resolution from pitch residuals by default

! 2015-01-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdTool: demote an info() printout to debug(), to keep the log files
   clean

! 2015-01-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeeding & friends: more work to take advantage of PatForwardHit::isOT()

! 2015-01-25 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdTool: add option to use pitch residuals to resolve ambiguities in
   the OT in a manner similar to the seeding; this results in slight
   efficiency gains (permille level), a ghost rate reduction on the percent
   level and a very marginal speedup (half a percent); there is a property
   which can be used to enable the new code:

   from Configurables import PatForward, PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool
   fwd = PatForward('PatForward')
   fwd.addTool(PatForwardTool, name='PatForwardTool')
   fwd.PatForwardTool.addTool(PatFwdTool, name='PatFwdTool')
   fwd.PatForwardTool.PatFwdTool.AmbiguitiesFromPitchResiduals = True

   The old method of resolving ambiguities remains the default for now.

 - PatSeeding and classes used by it: take advantage of the new isOT()
   method available from PatForwardHit

! 2015-01-22 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForward and PatForwardTool: Moved options to flag hits and seeds from
   PatForward to PatForwardTool, such that PatForwardTool is aware of hit
   flagging. Changed the flag wich is used to flag used hits.  Removed
   option to flag Velo seeds as at this point it is not clear which Velo
   seeds should be flagged.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r38 2015-01-14 =========================
! 2015-01-09 - Michel De Cian
 - New parametrisations in 'PatMatchTool', lower ghost right and higher
   efficiency, mostly for low p tracks.

! 2015-01-08 - Michel De Cian
 - Make Tool in PatMatch a configurable name, add 'getIfExists' and some
   doxygen comments.

! 2014-12-22 - Michel De Cian
 - Fix bug in PatAddTTCoord in 'returnTTClusters' which caused wrong chi2 to
   be returned.  Calculate part of the bending parameter only once per
   event. Add some doxygen comments.

! 2014-12-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTool: use new PatForwardHit methods to speed things up 
   (note: relies on new PatKernel, and one must recompile TfKernel and TfTools 
    as the methods rely on items set in an inline c'tor!)

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r37 2014-12-11 =========================
! 2014-12-11 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTrackCondidate: use vdt::fast_isqrt 
 - PatFwdTool: speed up distanceForFit, simplify inline methods

! 2014-12-10 - Sebastian Neubert
 - PatForward uses Ranges now to access track selections as well as containers

! 2014-11-29 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: small speedup in fillXList

! 2014-11-29 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTrackCanddiate: 
     o move data members to the 'top' of the class so that one can use 'auto' 
       (trailing) return specifitation
     o improve PatFwdTrackCandidate memory layout: move 'cold' pointer towards 
       the 'back'
 - PatFwdTool: better use of ranges
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter: add addHitwWhile
 - PatForwardTool: cleanup

! 2014-11-29 - Michel De Cian
 - Fix in PatDownstream such that hits in at least three layers are required for a track.

! 2014-11-13 - Michel De Cian
 - New implementation of the search for compatible hits in PatAddTTCoord. Faster, but efficiency performance should be stable.

! 2014-10-27 - Marco Cattaneo
 - PatDownstream: avoid interrogating the MagneticFieldSvc at every track to get
   the signedRelativeCurrent, once per event is enough!

! 2014-10-17 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: modernise some of the code somewhat; no functional changes,
   no changes in performance or timing

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r36 2014-10-14 =======================
! 2014-10-08 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - use the new SIMDChi2Fit framework for the seeding; efficiencies and ghost
   rates are stable at the permille level, timing is unaffected within the
   usual 5% fluctuations I see on my system

! 2014-10-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdFitParabola: reduce the # of multiplications needed. This slightly 
   changes the rounding, which affects the results at the 1e-5 level.
 - PatFwdRegionCounter, PatForwardTool: replace some for loops with std::for_each,
   more use of auto, improve formatting
 - PatFwdTool: make updateHitsForTrack a standalone function, factor out the
   fit in the Y projection, inline zMagnet, upgrade inRegion check from lambda
   to functor
 - PatFwdTool, PatForwardTool: replace (allmost) all double with auto, to make
   it easier to see how a single precision version would work at a later time.

! 2014-09-19 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: use boost::iterator_range, reduce triple nesting in loop 
   over station/layer/region to a single loop. Fix off-by-one bug
 - PatFwdTool: factor out search for 'best region' and 'shortest range',
   move towards providing a 'const' interface, use boost::iterator_range
 - PatForward: make acceptTrack const

! 2014-09-17 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: use specialized update{OT,NonOT}HitForTrack to avoid branches 
   in innermost loop

! 2014-09-09 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTool:setRLDefault: simplify enough so the compiler inlines
   the RLAmbiguityResolver completely
 - PatFwdTool: change max_projected_element to return the iterator pointing
   at the max element instead of the max element itself.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r35 2014-09-09 =======================
! 2014-09-09 - Gerhard Raven
 - fix failure in PatForward when running without B field

! 2014-09-05 - Gerhard Raven
 - make PatForwardTool so that it only exposes 'comst' methods.
 - PatFwdTool: tweak RL ambiguity resolution code so that it can
   be const

! 2014-08-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool, PatSeedTrack: use a Bloom filter to quickly detect tracks
   which have no overlap in hits after xz search; this allows for a slight
   speedup (up to 5% at high nu) and an O(1%) increase in efficiency (while
   the ghost rate remains stable within +/- 0.2%); the worst case timing of
   the algorithm is reduced by typically 40% (over the 1000 events tested)
   [technical note: the false positive probability for the Bloom Filter is
   chosen such that for 12 hits (maximum in the OT after xz search), the bit
   set in the Bloom Filter fits into 64 bits, this gives around 8% false
   positive probability, and seems to be the best compromise]
 - PatSeedingTool: properties CloneMaxXDistIT and CloneMaxXDistOT are obsolete
   now (BloomFilter is more reliable and faster)

! 2014-08-28 - Gerhard Raven
 - unify scalar and vector version of PatFwdTool::xAtReferencePlane_ by using
   variadic templates to gather/scatter the vectors to generate both scalar and
   vector versions from the same source, based on the number of arguments. 
   This produces optimal code for both cases (i.e. fully inlined, no extra 
   function calls) without having to write a lot of overloads and/or specializations 
   of the gather/scatter operations. 
 - generalize the vectorization types 
 - unify the with/without B-field versions of PatFwdTool::xAtReferencePlane

! 2014-08-22 - Gerhard Raven
 - Move the skipping of used hits from PatForwardTool to PatForward.
   This avoids having to look up all hits for all seeds, and instead
   does it once per event.
 - tweak some inline methods a bit...

! 2014-08-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - further optimize PatForwardTool:fillXList

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r34 2014-08-18 =========================

! 2014-08-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - insure that when using PatForwardTool directly, i.e. not from PatForward,
   that PatTStationHitManager::prepareHits() is invoked. 
   Without this call, the 'hasNext' and 'hasPrevious' information on PatForwardHits
   is missing -- which has an effect on OT hits when computing xAtReferencePlane, 
   and not all IT hits are sorted (those in the overlap regions are affected).
   With this call, the the decoding on demand is disabled, but then again, two
   tracks (one with y<0 and one with y>0) in the OT acceptance would eg. force the
   decoding of all OT modules anyway... and if one ends up decoding most modules
   anyway, might as well do it upfront, as that is actually faster...
   

! 2014-08-14 - Gerhard Raven
 - make PatFwdCandidate 'vector friendly' i.e. don't enforce types on a few
   member functions that perform arithmetic.
 - update PatFwdTool to use the above, and make it more 'type neutral' as well.

! 2014-08-09 - Gerhard Raven
 - ICC and clang both define __GNUC__ so that's not the right way to differentiate
   between compilers, so use __INTEL_COMPILER and __clang__ instead to recognize
   them.

! 2014-08-06 - Sebastian Neubert
 - added a few useful counters to PatForwardTool 
 - added TrackUsedLHCbID tool to PatForwardTool: allows to exclude hits that have already been used elsewhere

! 2014-08-06 - Gerhard Raven
 - enable vectorization only when using gcc...  icc and clang don't (yet) support all of the
    extensions used for this.

! 2014-08-06 - Sebastian Neubert
 - make the skipping of used seed tracks optional in PatForwardTool
   default: do not skip (false)
    can be switched on through property skipUsedSeeds
    note that a similar mechanism is also present in PatForward (the algorithm)

! 2014-08-05 - Gerhard Raven
 - provide, and use vector, interface version of PatFwdTool::xAtReference, PatFwdTool::setXAtReference
 - update PatForwardTool to use above vector interface (changes results at the permille
    level as x boundaries are now treated left-right symmetrically)
 - implement an explicitly vectorized (using gcc vector extension, see
    https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html; note that clang
    supports these as well: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#vectors-and-extended-vectors), 
    branch-free version of PatFwdTool::xAtReference, and use it in PatFwdTool::setXAtReference

! 2014-08-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - specialize PatFwdTool::xAtReference 

! 2014-08-01 - Gerhard Raven
 - fix clang brace warnings

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r33 2014-06-10 ======================
! 2014-05-28 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter: generalize checkingPolicy to allow generic, statefull predicates;
                       employ 'empty base class' optimization to insure that object size 
                       is unaffected when a stateless predicate is provided.
 - PatFwdTool: use a predicated PatFwdPlaneCounter to count planes for selected hits in 
               specified region; reduce code duplication
 
! 2014-05-27 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter: add 'checkingPolicy' so that, if wanted,  the 'isSelected' check 
   can be disabled (at compile time) in case it is a-priori known to always return
   true. Default policy (for backwards compatibility) is to perform the check for isSelected.
 - PatFwdRegionCounter: remove virtual destructor, add 'final' qualification.
 
! 2014-05-26 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTool: 
      o optimize rl-ambiguity resolution, 
      o unify with{,out} B-field computation of X @ reference plane
      o use PatFwdPlaneCounter::addUntilEnough 
 - PatForwardTool: improve x search window computation


! 2014-05-25 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTrackCandidate,PatFwdTool : improve const-correctness 
 - PatFwdTrackCandidate,PatFwdFit{Line,Parabola} : consolidate data members in std::array
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter: add addHitsUntilEnough, always invoke addHits internally

! 2014-05-17 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: 
    o use lambdas to hoist invariants out of loops
    o consolidate x searchwindow determination in single function

! 2014-05-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: 
    o combine find_range and make_single_zone into a single call to a mem_fn 
      of a 'sentinel' object which controls the peak finding loop.
    o better utilization of above 'sentinel' in loop control

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r32 2014-05-13 ======================
! 2014-05-10 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForwardTool: 
     o consolidate make_single_zone 
     o replace some loops by std::for_each
     o make sortQuality a constexpr literal
     o use override
     o use Gaudi::extends2

 - PatForward: clarify overlap logic

! 2014-03-27 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatFwdTool: factor out and lift max finding, range extension

! 2014-03-26 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForward: tweak overlap bookkeeping
 - PatFwdTrackCandidate: compactify, add noexcept move assignment and copy c'tor
 - PatForwardTool: 
      o use in-situ remove_if/erase instead of swapping between vectors when removing candidates
      o factor out some simple computations
      o lift the range finding

! 2014-03-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool: various little fixes which do not hurt, but improve timing by
   12% for PatSeeding and 5% for TrackBestTrackCreator, with marginal
   improvements to efficiencies and ghost rate of the Seeding
   - some code refactoring to increase code reuse
   - have a clear bail-out strategy for fits which do not converge, propagate
     that error to callers
   - fit in xz projection now uses cubic term from the start (used to be
     neglected initially because the full fit in both projections will take it
     into account later)
   - adjust both quadratic and cubic terms of underlying track in fit
     (slightly faster convergence, better tracks)

! 2014-03-25 - Gerhard Raven
 - PatForward: factor out and optimize overlap count

! 2014-03-25 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - Fix fix from Chris Jones introduced in r168699 to work around an FPE in
   PatSeedingTool (not documented in the release notes); the new version of
   the code helps to marginally reduce the ghost rate while still avoiding the
   FPE

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r24 2012-06-28 ======================
! 2012-06-27 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add a flag to activate a workaround for certain problematic properties in
   PatSeedingTool which get their values set wrong when being extracted from
   a TCK because the precision to which the numerical values of these
   properties is saved in the TCK is insufficient
   
   the workaround is to overwrite these properties with default values if
   PatSeedingTool is run in an HLT context

   there is a property (ActivateHltPropertyHack) which can disable this hack
   in the future once it's no longer needed; for now, the default is to
   activate the hack in HLT contexts, other applications like Brunel and
   DaVinci should remain unaffected, since they're not running with HLT
   context (and they set the default values anyway, unless the pattern reco
   expert running the job has explicitly decreed otherwise in his/her job
   options)

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r23 2012-04-24 ======================

 - PatMatchTool : Momentum estimate now protected against failure.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r22 2012-04-24 ======================
! 2012-04-23 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatMatchTool : Added option MinMomentum and MinPt to reject tracks with a certain momentum.
 - PatDownstream : Added option MinMomentum and MinPt to reject tracks with a certain momentum.

! 2012-04-19 - Michel De Cian
 - PatMatchTool: Make the name of the tool that adds the TT hits a property (helpful for testing modified TT hit adding 
tools)
 - PatAddTTCoord: Adapting parameters to optimal values found in MC11a and fixing the slope at zMSPoint instead of 
zTTField in the chi2 fit.

! 2012-04-18 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatDownstream: Added options to set the output location of the matching and forward
   tracking in PatDownstream. Now used seeds and tt hits can be removed
   also in the HLT.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r21 2012-04-09 ======================
! 2012-04-05 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: Bug fix in PatForward, flag for left right ambiguity is now reset when
                   collecting hits.Before independence of different iterations 
                   of the Forward tracking was broken.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r20 2012-03-16 ======================
!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r19 2012-03-07 ======================
! 2012-02-23 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: Bug fix in PatForward in part which uses momentum estimate.
                    Variable was shadowed, resulting in wrong behaviour of 
                    the algorithm.

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r18 2012-02-28 ======================
! 2012-02-23 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatForwardTool: Bug fix in PatForward in part which uses momentum estimate.   

! 2012-02-14 - Sascha Stahl
 - PatDownstream: make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit
   in HLT
 - PatForwardTool: Changed parametrisation of first search window in x. Required 
    to add property "MagnetKickParams" to PatForwardTool. 
 - PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool: Fixed part which uses momentum estimate. 
   This part of the code was not used anywhere or if it was used it could not 
   work.
   Removed property "RangeErrorFraction" and changed default value of "MinRange".
    To make sure that the user knows that a momentum estimate is used, 
   added property "UseMomentumEstimate" which is false by default.
   
! 2012-02-09 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - change calls to std::sort where hits were sorted by a potentially unstable
   sorting criterium to use std::stable_sort; the reason is that there is a
   possibility that we end up with more than one hit at the same z (e.g. two
   hits in same layer), so the result of the sort will depend on the
   implementation of std::sort - using std::stable_sort instead avoids that
   (these changes have to be applied in addition to those in Tf/TfKernel to
   fix differences observed between gcc 4.3 and gcc 4.6)
 - PatFwdTrackCandidate: avoid some memory allocations in handling the vector
   of PatFwdHits
 - FastForwardTool, PatAddTTCoord: replace std::vector by boost::array to avoid
   memory allocations
 - PatDownTrack: avoid needless copying of parameter vectors, preallocate
   space for hit container
 - work on const correctness (where possible)

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r17 2012-01-31 ======================
! 2012-01-31 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatMatchTool: make sure we copy all three states in T to help the fast fit
   in HLT
 - PatMatchTool: clean up and streamline the code somewhat while we're at it;
   one minor change in behaviour: if momentum estimate tool fails (as far as I
   can see, the current implementation cannot fail), we don't touch the
   momentum estimates of states on a newly created track, we rely on the
   algorithms which supply these tracks to do something reasonable in that
   case

! 2012-01-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - include somewhat more fine-grained timing measurements in PatSeedingTool for
   the initial x search (not active by default)
 - for trigger use, add the NDblOTHitsInXSearch property which cuts on the
   number of double hits in the OT (i.e. hits in two monolayers of the same
   layer) for the three layers which are used to form the initial search parabola
   if that number is lower then NDblOTHitsInXSearch, the candidate is abandoned
   early
   the default value for the new property is 0, so the default behaviour does
   not change, however, putting 2 there in the trigger saved O(20%) execution
   time while only 0.5-1% of efficiency is lost (all momenta, for p > 5GeV, the
   efficiency loss is on the order of 0.1-0.3%)

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r16 2011-11-25 ======================
! 2011-11-24 - Michel De Cian
 - Fix in PatAddTTCoord: If chi2 was still much too high with only 3 hits left (in method
   calculateChi2), it went into an infinite loop.

! 2011-11-23 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix gcc46 warnings and some icc remarks

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r15 2011-11-08 ======================
! 2011-09-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix insane TES usage in PatSeedFit reported by Markus Frank today on the
   lhcb-reconstruction mailing list: instead of getting the container of
   STLiteClusters for every track, we cache the pointer for the duration of
   the event (no changes in performance, though)
 - properly initialise a few pointers in the constructor of PatSeedFit while
   I am at it

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r14 2011-07-27 ======================
! 2011-07-26 - Marco Cattaneo
 - In PatAlgConf.py, apply global global event cuts taken from
   TrackSys().GlobalCuts to PatSeeding and PatForward. If GEC on Velo hits is
   set, cut on Velo tracks in PatForward is removed
 - In PatSeedingTool, skip event processing if the VELO ProcStatus abort is set.
   Switched on by new option "AbortOnVeloAbort", true by default

! 2011-07-25 - Jeroen Van Tilburg
 - Added NCandCommonHits to TrackInfo field for calculation of ghost prob.

! 2011-07-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Create debug() and verbose() messages only when output level requires it,
   also using UNLIKELY macro
 - Replace all endreq by endmsg

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r13 2011-06-15 ====================
! 2011-06-11 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: revert back to old (pre-early data) tuning, and make
   current tuning available as early data tuning again - the old tuning turned
   out to be better when the detector is not roughly misaligned
 - PatSeedingTool: tighten CurveTol from 5 mm to 3mm; during the x candidate
   search, this parameter influences how close the hit in T2 must be to the
   prediction based on hits in T1 and T3 - this has been shown to help
   efficiency and improve the behaviour of the algorithm in very busy events
   by killing a certain amount of combinatorics
 - PatSeedingTool: during x candidate search, consider only the best and
   next-to-best candidates (best here means hit in T2 is closest to
   prediction) to further reduce combinatoric buildup in busy events; if the
   best candidate satisfies quality cuts, use it greedily, i.e. discarding a
   potentially existing next-to-best candidate

! 2011-05-02 - Victor Coco

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r12 2011-02-28 =========================
! 2011-02-19 - Chris Jones
 - Fix coverity performance warning in PatForwardTool

! 2011-02-07 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool/PatSeedTrack: protect against removal of essential layers (at
   least 2 X and 2 stereo layers have to remain)
 - PatSeedFit: protect against numerical difficulties when processing very
   low quality tracks (these exist due to earlyData tuning is now default)
 - PatSeedingTool: m_momentumScale is set too big, needs multiplication with a
   factor 0.8 to give the right estimate; since momentum estimates usually
   come from the FastMomentumEstimate tool, this change is mostly cosmetic and
   should not influence performance

! 2011-02-04 - Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer
 - add check for untested status code

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r11 2011-02-02 =========================
! 2011-02-01 - Olivier Callot
 - Add a new cut in PatForwardTool to exclude dirty area, MaxXCandidateSize = 50
   This gains 15% of the time for almost no change in efficiency/ghost rate

! 2011-01-27 - Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer
 - set early data tunings as default

! 2011-01-24 - Olivier Callot

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r10 2011-01-17 =========================
! 2011-01-17 - Rob Lambert

   where a double was used to + an iterator, now an int is used.

! 2011-01-11 - Olivier Callot
 - Minor changes to improve efficiency: USe proper scaling for drift distance in X projection

! 2010-12-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Add an option to define the Forward tool name in PatForward
 - New implementation of the forward tracking, called FastForwardTool.
   To use it, set the option PatForward().ForwardToolName = "FastForwardTool"
   This gives efficiency increase with lower ghost rate, and is faster.
   This is a first version...

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r8 2010-12-08 =========================

!========================= PatAlgorithms v4r7 2010-09-27 =========================

! 2010-09-24 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - add an earlyData tuning for PatSeeding

! 2010-09-23 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: make cuts on stereo hit content during per region search
   explicit as job options (applies to OT only)
 - PatSeedingTool: modify these cuts to prevent them from killing a large
   fraction of the tracks going through a dead module
 - PatSeedingTool: introduce a job option for the tolerance used to check
   if a hit is inside the sensitive area (along y) of a straw or strip
   (the default is 4 cm which should be plenty)
 - PatSeedingTool: move one check for y compatibility (see previous item)
   from collectPerRegion() to collectStereoHits() to kill bad hits earlier

! 2010-09-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - make the fit in PatSeedFit more similar to what is done in PatSeeding
   also clean up code somewhat (remove unused/superfluous members)
   (this piece of code is used in TrackStateInitTool)
 - PatSeedTool: minor change in refitStub() to make the method safer for
   usage in PatSeedFit

! 2010-09-06 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - fix compiler (gcc-4.3 on SLC5) warning in PatSeedTrack.h

! 2010-09-02 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool: resolve OT ambiguities from pitch residuals by default, old
   default is available as job option (new method is faster and produces fewer
   ghosts while keeping practically same efficiency; the RMS of the OT pull is
   slightly narrower)
 - PatSeedTool: account for track slopes correctly when calculating hit-track
   distances in OT
 - PatSeedTool: simultaneous fit to X, U, V projections instead of separate
   fits to X and Y projections (helps a little with real data in presence of
   residual misalignments since there are about twice as many layers entering
   the fit) - slightly slower than old method, but we gain enough with the new
   ambiguity resolver above to have a net speed gain
 - fixed bug in PatSeedingTool/PatSeedTool (code checking if a hit is in OT or
   IT)
 - fixed bug in PatSeedingTool: in collectITOT, a final track fit was omitted
   under certain circumstances, causing a drop in efficiency
 - PatSeedingTool: allow for 2 station IT tracks
 - PatSeedingTool: in collectITOT, refit the one-station IT stubs before
   continuing, killing combinatorics where possible
 - PatSeedingTool: account for rotations of entire layers around x and y axes
   when calculating search windows (beam tilt was accounted for before, so no
   changes there)
 - PatSeedingTool: change maximum occupancy cuts to cuts on maximum number of
   IT and OT hits (3000 and 10000, respectively)
 - PatSeedingTool: make sure that we stay roughly inside sensitive region in
   y as we pick up stereo hits
 - PatSeedingTool: slight tuning of cuts

! 2009-11-26 Manuel Schiller
 - use ROOT::Math::CholeskyDecomp provided by ROOT since version 5.24 instead
   of reimplementing code to solve a system of linear equations in which the
   matrix is symmetric and has positive eigenvalues (we have been using a
   variant of this in the Kalman Filter for some time; by checking this, we
   catch crappy tracks and numerical problems which make the chi^2 function
   either have a saddle point in parameter space at its stationary point (at
   least one eigenvalue is negative) or make chi^2 constant along some
   direction in parameter space (at least on eigenvector is zero))
   consequently use any indication of a singular matrix (or one with negative
   eigenvalues) provided by ROOT::Math::CholeskyDecomp to stop processing that
   track before we can divide by zero, obtain NaNs or get into any other kind
   of trouble
   Affected classes: PatAddTTCoord, PatDownstream, PatFwdFitLine,

 - PatSeedingTool: fix bug introduced in change to improve IT cosmics
   reconstruction (bug effectively turned off OT reconstruction in non-cosmic
   mode)

! 2008-08-26 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: fix for L0 confirmation: account properly for tilt in
   search windows derived from state given by caller
 - PatSeedingTool: use newly introduced PatRange object to represent search
   windows (PatRange consists of upper and lower edge of an interval and
   was mainly introduced to help debugging the previous issue)
 - PatSeedingTool: fix for cosmics: in X search, try all combinations of
   regions to find initial three x hits (allowing hits in IT to be found)
 - PatSeedingTool: fix for fallback momentum estimate: if FastMomentumTool
   returns failure for some reason and we run without magnetic field, return
   momentum 1 GeV with uncertainty on q/p = 1 / 1MeV
 - PatSeedingTool: when specifying track model parameters as options, make
   sure that initialize() does not overwrite them
 - PatSeedTool, PatSeedTrack, PatSeedingTool: use unsigned instead of int
   if we know that a number is positive

! 2008-08-20 - Stepanie Hansmann-Menzemer

     to zero
   - use boost::assign::list_of where applicable when declaring properties
 - PatSeedTool:
   - more effective protection against singular matrix in fit
   - use of BOOST_FOREACH to clean up code
   - more straightforward bit-shifting when trying to fix ambiguities
 - PatSeedingTool:

     upper half of the OT when we know that the track is in the lower half and
     vice-versa
   - use of BOOST_FOREACH to clean up code
   - more straightforward bit-shifting when trying to fix ambiguities

- add python directory with PatForward.py and PatSeeding.py scripts

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r7 2008-07-02 ====================
! 2008-07-02 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: added code to deal better with cosmics, specifically:
   - strategy is to seed cosmics with the OT, then pick up IT hits which
     are close to the track (IT too small to have cosmic hits in more
     than one station)
   - when looking for cosmics in the OT, allow for tracks which migrate
     between upper and lower OT half
   - when recognizing the pattern in the stereo layers, use an alternate
     version of the findBestRange routine which does not assume that the
     track points back to the PV in yz projection (i.e. we use a simple
     combinatorial approach - in general, don't use the cosmic tuning on data
     obtained with beam on, it will most probably be too slow!)
 - add option file to find cosmics
   might need some tuning if e.g. layers v,x are missing in every station
   should work fine as long as either A or C side of OT is closed
   not well tuned yet (especially IT: nothing done/seen so far)
 - removed superfluous include file (fenv.h)

! 2008-06-29 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - tuning for new field map, now used per default
   - added new tuning for old field map, see
     options/PatSeedingTool-field047.opts
   - fixed a bug in the code calculating cluster positions, we now really do
     it the "Kisel" way (apart from the fact that we protect against division
     by 0, see below)
     we now use x_clus = (r_2 * x_1 + r_1 * x_2) / (r_1 + r_2), z_clus is done
     in the same way; to avoid divisions by zero, we take
       r_i = sqrt( (drift radius for hit i)^2 + measurement variance)
     i.e. the model is almost linear in r_drift, and it degenerates into the
     arithmetic mean of the wire positions if we run without using drift time
     information
   - made new option-controllable parameter OTNHitsLowThresh which gives the
     threshold below which OT only tracks have to satisfy stricter criteria
     (nicer than a literal 17 in the code)
   - add options to extract T station part of Forward tracks and add resulting
     tracks to output container (in addition to ignoring hits used by
     PatForward which was possible already previously)
 - PatSeedTrack: changes to follow new parametrisation in PatSeedingTool

! 2008-06-09 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix a possible divide-by-zero in PatDownstream, line 604.

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r6 2008-06-05 ====================
! 2008-06-05 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Remove unneccessary machine specific include (inexistent on Windows)

! 2008-06-04 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedTool: various fixes to avoid dividing by zero (could and did happen
   when there were too few hits to determine fit parameters for the track
   model)
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - protect against a division by zero in initialize
   - increase m_minMomentum to 500 MeV - very few tracks lost
   - several adjustments triggered by the changes to PatSeedTool above
   - several changes to improve efficiency:
     - IT, per region: allow to form x candidates starting with all possible
       combinations of x layers in the tree stations
     - IT, per region: if few x hits are present in left/right boxes, we're
       probably in the dead region between the two ladders, so restrict
       stereo search as is already done for OT
     - IT/OT: additional pass looking for tracks passing between different IT
       regions and considering upper and lower OT halves for tracks near y=0,
       also relax requirements on tracks slightly in this case
     - OT, per region: additional pass for tracks at high fabs(y) where tracks
       are almost straight - so we set m_initialArrow temporarily to zero
   - some checks skipping unneccessary stages for trigger applications to keep
     the high speed from previous versions

! 2008-05-27 - Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer
 - removed all float variables, replaced them by doubles

! 2008-05-23 - Johannes Albrecht
   - PatMatchTool.cpp: set unused variable quality2 to 0 (needed for Hlt interface)

! 2008-05-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Get IMatchTool.h from TrackInterfaces

! 2008-05-21 - Johannes Albrecht
   - PatMatchTool.h / .cpp: Add interface for implementation in Hlt

! 2008-05-21 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool: fixed a bug in the y window calculation used in L0
   confirmation (no tacks are found in the L0 case)

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r5 2008-05-16 ====================
! 2008-05-15 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter, PatFwdRegionCounter:
   order of arguments to std::distance were given in reverse order, leading to
   slightly decreased performance in PatForward - swapped aruments so that
   order is correct now

! 2008-05-14 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - PatFwdPlaneCounter:
   - now uses boost::array instead of std::vector for arrays with known size
     at compile time -> see some small speed improvements for very hot events
   - class itself no longer templated on hit type, instead, methods taking
     hits (or iterators) are templated
 - PatFwdRegionCounter:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
 - PatForwardTool, PatFwdTool:
   - follow-up changes for the changes in PatFwdPlaneCounter above
   - added some consts where possible to facilitate optimization by the
     compiler
 - PatSeedTool:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - added a missing minus sign in the initial iteration of the stereo fit
   - added const to methods that do not change the object
 - PatSeedTrack:
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - added assignment operator
   - removed unused members
   - decreasingQuality() ordering class can now be used to sort containers
     of objects as well (if desired) - used to be only pointers to objects
 - PatSeedingTool:
   - in collectStereoHits: restore coordinates only for the hits we actually
     intend to consider further, not for the whole region
     dramatic speed improvement, as collectStereoHits is executed once for
     each candidate in xz
   - save low quality tracks with high impact y during per region search, add
     additional pass at the end of the algorithm to recover some of these
     tracks (if not too many used hits)
     this is fast (ca 0.7 ms/event), other improvements to algorithm actually
     save more time than we spend here
   - added code to account for OT tilt (dz/dy) before track in y is known
     (need to slightly widen search windows, otherwise, upper and lower half
     of OT show different efficiency at high fabs(y))
     this involves code needed to get dz/dy and z at y=0 for a region
   - boost::array instead of std::vector, see above
   - regrouped property declarations so that related properties form groups
   - improved debugging code: per stage timing has not survived move from
     algorithm to tool, now resurrected
   - cut on drift radii now available as job option
   - when counting hits with some property to see if some cut is exceeded,
     we now stop early when we hit the boundary
   - improved memory management for temporary track candidates (read: faster)
   - methods for each pass of the algorithm over the hits to make separation
     clearer
   - added convenience functions and typedefs to access the hit manager
   - during xz search, cluster positions in the OT are now calculated the
     "Kisel" way, weighting each hit with 1/(r^2+sigma^2); this gives
     slightly better results because the parabola through these points is
     closer to the true track then
   - retuned some of the default properties for improved performance
   - now uses FastMomentumEstimate tool to have all the parametrizations
     available centrally in one place
   - prepareHits() now returns the number of hits returned by the hit
     manager - this might be useful for some applications and is easily
     ignored in all others
   - I'm sure I forgot something...
 - PatSeeding:
   - use private instance of PatSeedingTool to allow different configurations
     for different instances of the algorithm

! 2008-05-08 - Johannes Albrecht
 - PatMatchTool: - New implementation of PatMatch as tool
                         - public function: matchSingle for Hlt
                         - quality of match is now job option: maxMatchChi2
                         - momentum of matched tracks is calculated with tool
 - PatMatch: algorithm which only calls the tool

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r4p1 2008-03-25 ==================
! 2008-03-25 - Jan Amoraal
 - Removed white space from property impactCurrentNorm in PatMakeV0. 
   Python doesn't like it.
 - Fixed option in PatFwdTool.opts
  +  zMagnetParams -> ZMagnetParams
 
!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r4 2008-02-18 ====================
! 2008-02-18 - Manuel Schiller
 - PatSeedingTool can now take an optional state giving a hint where a track
   is to be found; this is useful for the HLT when confirming L0 candidates
   a track is searched for in a +/- one sigma window which is derived from the
   covariance matrix of the state which is extrapolated with a straight line
   model into the T stations
 - added job option which makes it possible to ignore hits used in a previous
   run of PatSeedingTool; application is again in HLT when trying to confirm
   several hypotheses in a combined window
 - added some missing comments to PatSeedingTool.cpp and the corresponding
   header file to better document member variables

!========================== PatAlgorithms v3r3 2008-01-28 ====================
! 2008-01-28 - Manuel Schiller
 - added code to PatSeedingTool to perform better without magnetic field
   does not affect performance at all when running with default settings
 - added code to PatSeedingTool to allow better tuning when running with
   a misaligned detector
   does not affect performance at all when running with default settings
 - added code to PatSeedTool to fix a corner case which could produce NaNs
   as track parameters:
   In a few cases, the line fit in y projection could start to oscillate
   wildly. The x coordinates of hits are modified according to the track's
   y, which causes an even more violent shift in y parameters on the next
   iteration - eventually, you'll find NaNs all over the place. The bad thing
   about this is that these hits with NaNs as coordinates may cause the fit
   of other tracks in that event to fail as well.
   To put a stop to this, the fit will now discard tracks which change their
   slope in yz projection by more than 1.0. This improves efficiency and
   decreases ghost rate slightly.

! 2008-01-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Modify again PatMatch to use std::map<int,bool>, which is correct in that order.

! 2008-01-16 - Olivier Callot
