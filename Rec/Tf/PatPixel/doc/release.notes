!========================= PatPixel v1r1 2013-06-03 =========================
! 2013-05-28 - Wouter Hulsbergen
 - implemented a simple fixed-noise kalman filter to improve IP resolution

! 2013-05-24 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Include missing PatKernel dependency

!========================= PatPixel v1r0 2013-02-14 =========================
! 2013-02-08 - Diego Martinez Santos
 - Added correction to the bias in cluster positions, as well as a slope
   dependent correction for two pixel clusters. 
   This might cause for the moment a loss of speed.

! 2013-02-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CMake.

! 2013-02-01 - Sascha Stahl
 - Added CMake file

! 2013-01-30 - Olivier Callot
 - Add option "ClearHits" to clear the hits, for rerunning the VP pattern twice.

! 2012-12-09 - Pawel Jalocha
 - debug histograms added (activate with DEBUG_HISTO)
 - added comments, as I understand the code works

! 2012-01-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Re-implementation of the algorithm, based on finding a pair of consecutive hits
   and extrapolating in both directions.
   Tested on 900 events: 0.9% ghosts, 99.7% efficient, 0.5% clones, 1.35 ms/event
   Improvements are possible, but a better clustering is probably the most 
   important one

! 2012-01-10 - Olivier Callot
 - First version. The overall structure is taken form FastVelo.
   New logic to make the search: Find enough hits in a seed region before 
   extrapolating. This seed region can extend acroos the half detector boundary.

   Initial performance is great:  <2% ghosts, >99.5% efficiency for long > 5 GeV,
                                  <0.5% clones, and only < 1.5 ms per event. 
      This is obtained on a limited sample.
