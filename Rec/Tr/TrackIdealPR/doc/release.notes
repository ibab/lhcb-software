 - dependance on old Checker/ITrJudge.h removed. Same functionality is given
   by TrCheck/TrAcceptance.h
 - dependance on old Checker/ITrStateCreator.h removed. Same functionality
   given by TrCheck/ITrStateCreator.h
 - the output are still TrFitTracks according to the old tracking model

 - adaptation to GaudiAlgorithm

! 2005-02-23 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - package creation. Simple renaming of the Tr/IdealPR package of
