! Package     : Rich/RichRecSys
! Responsible : Chris Jones
! Purpose     : Co-ordinates the RICH reconstruction packages
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= RichRecSys v5r9 2016-01-28 =========================
! 2016-01-18 - Chris Jones
 - Add a configuration flag to make sure the MC association information for
   tracks is prepared before the RICH reconstruction sequence. Default is off.
   Useful for expert studies where MC information is used during the 
   reconstruction to cheat various aspects.

! 2016-01-06 - Chris Jones
 - Fix option to run an algorithm to preload the TES with the raw input tracks
   (useful for timing studies when running on DSTs).
 - Add new configuration parameters to allow the number of ray trace photons
   per CK mass hypothesis ring to be set.

! 2016-01-04 - Chris Jones
 - Propagate custom options for groupConfig.richTools().photonReco()
   ( really need a better solution for this sometime... )

!========================= RichRecSys v5r8 2015-11-23 =========================
! 2015-10-26 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a minor bug where custom options for RichTools where not properly
   propagated to the track group configurables. No impact on normal processing,
   only when running with special custom options.

!========================= RichRecSys v5r7 2015-05-26 =========================
! 2015-05-12 - Chris Jones
 - No longer throw an exception if an instance of the RichRecSysConf is
   created without its reconstruction sequence defined. Instead print
   a warning and do nothing. Currently needed due to the changes in RecConf to 
   support multiple track groupings. Might be improved in the future...

!========================= RichRecSys v5r6 2015-04-21 =========================
! 2015-04-11 - Chris Jones
 - Small change in the RichRecSysConf trackTypeIsActive method to fix a 
   issue where the Long Track monitors in RichRecQC cwent missing after
   the last commit.

! 2015-04-10 - Chris Jones
 - Avoid creating reconstruction sequences for track groups that would fail
   the tracking cuts (as their types are not included).

! 2015-03-19 - Chris Jones
 - Forcibly set the Context correctly before anything else, in all used 
   configurables.

! 2015-03-13 - Chris Jones
 - Do not append final RichPID merger to algorithm sequence if PID is 
   globally turned off.

! 2015-03-11 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a small problem in the configurables that cause custom settings to
   not always be properly propagated.

! 2015-03-10 - Chris Jones
 - Rework things to avoid assumptions based on the order things are applied.

! 2015-03-09 - Chris Jones
 - Update the python configurable to support running with seperate processing
   sequences for different track groups. Enabled by calling the method
        
        richConf = RichRecSysConf(self.richRecConfName)
        richConf.setTrackGroups( [ ["Forward","Match"],
                                   ["VeloTT"], ["KsTrack"] ] )

   Important - This *must* be done before any applyCOnf method is called.
   Default mode is to work as before, with all track types considered at
   the same time in the likelihood minimisation.

!========================= RichRecSys v5r5 2015-02-23 =========================
! 2015-02-20 - Chris Jones
 - Add a new configuration option "RefitTracks" which enables a full refit of
   the tracks prior to running the RICH reconstruction on them.

! 2015-02-06 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a small bug with the "PreloadTracks" options that was failing to 
   properly enable this option.

!========================= RichRecSys v5r4 2015-01-14 =========================
! 2015-01-14 - Chris Jones
 - Make all defaults for HLT Context the same as Offline.

!========================= RichRecSys v5r3 2014-07-14 =========================
! 2014-06-20 - Chris Jones
 - Disable Aerogel for Run II DataTypes (2015 onwards).

!========================= RichRecSys v5r2 2014-05-13 =========================
! 2014-05-08 - Chris Jones
 - Add new OnlineMode property. Tunes the reconstruction as appropriate for
   Online Brunel, so it can be used for the Online HPD and refractive index
   run by run calibrations.
 - Explicitly set the CKThetaQuartzRefractCorrections to 0,0,0 for real data.
   Systematic differences between different photon reconstruction methods now
   handled seperately.

!========================= RichRecSys v5r1 2014-02-19 =========================
! 2014-02-08 - Chris Jones
 - Add an explicit tuning of the photon reconstruction for the Upgrade.

! 2013-12-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add support for 'pA' SpecialData type, to set special GECs developed for
   Reco14r1 reprocessing of 2013 heavy ion data

!========================= RichRecSys v5r0 2013-12-10 =========================
! 2013-11-28 - Rob Lambert
 - Was adding the wrong algorithm to the sequence... some wierd interferrence between cloning and the name.
    Fixed now.

! 2013-11-27 - Rob Lambert
 - Migrate to using the DecodersDB, requires LHCb v36r4, major change.

!========================= RichRecSys v4r9 2013-11-12 =========================
! 2013-11-12 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a logic flaw that caused a configuration error when PidConfig="None".

!========================= RichRecSys v4r8 2013-10-01 =========================
! 2013-07-25 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a bug in the previous changes, that was causing some Upgrade tunings
   to be wrongly applied in non-Upgrade scenarios.

! 2013-07-24 - Chris Jones
 - Import some Upgrade specific tunings and tweeks. Applied automatically
   when the DataType property is set to "Upgrade". 
   This is work in progress, as some of them indicate some possible issues in 
   the code that need to be looked into.

!========================= RichRecSys v4r7p1 2013-04-30 =========================
! 2013-04-09 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add __init__.py to please CMake

!========================= RichRecSys v4r7 2012-11-28 =========================
! 2012-11-26 - Chris Jones
 - Add 'DataType' option to PhotonCreator configurable. 
   Setting is propagated down from higher level Configurable.
 - Loosen of a little the Aerogel photon selection cuts, as the lower edge
   was a little too tight and cutting into low momentum Protons.

! 2012-11-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

! 2012-10-08 - Marco Cattaneo
 - In Configuration.py and RichGlobalPID_.py, remove setting of MeasureTime=True
   in sequencers, should not be the default, and should in any case use
   TimingAuditor.

!========================= RichRecSys v4r6 2012-06-25 =========================
! 2012-06-03 - Chris Jones
 - Remove the CK theta correction factor for Aerogel. Will be taken into
   account in an incoming recalibration.

!========================= RichRecSys v4r5 2012-04-30 =========================
! 2012-04-30 - Chris Jones
 - Make the default list of tracks used in the HLT the same as offline.
 - Update offline track chi^2 cut from 0->10 to 0->5. Tracking now applies
   its own cut anyway (0->3 currently) so this no longer does anything, but
   keep just for sanity check.
 - Improve the way the track types are set, to fix a bug in the HLT where the
   requested track types to use was not always respected.

!========================= RichRecSys v4r4 2011-08-31 =========================
! 2011-08-25 - Chris Jones
 - Explicitly set options for the pixel background tools, for each iteration

!========================= RichRecSys v4r3 2011-07-27 ========================

   the moment)
  + MaxUsedTracks set to 1000(Offline) or 500(HLT)
  + MaxPixels set to 30000 everywhere (previous 20000 in global PID)

!========================= RichRecSys v4r1 2011-04-05 ========================
! 2011-03-24 - Chris Jones
 - Increase a bit the size of the photon selection window for Rich1gas when

   resolution calculations

!======================= RichRecSys v3r33 2010-10-28 =========================
! 2010-10-15 - Chris Jones
 - Fine tune the photon creator selection cuts to take into account the better
   gas resolutions in the latest database updates.

!====================== RichRecSys v3r32 2010-07-26 ==========================
! 2010-09-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add new "Wide" photon selection, that enlarges the selection a bit, in 
   order to get more of the tails. The idea is it provides a loose enough 
   selection to give enough of the sidebands to understand the background
   shape, not not as loose as the "Loose" selection.

!====================== RichRecSys v3r31 2010-07-26 ==========================

! 2010-07-07 - Chris Jones
 - Turn off the "earlyData" loose photon selection cuts. 

!====================== RichRecSys v3r29p1 2010-06-21 ========================

!====================== RichRecSys v1r12 2004-07-22 ======================
! 2004-07-22 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Updates to packages for release with Gaudi v15

!====================== RichRecSys v1r11 2004-06-18 ======================
! 2004-06-18 - Chris Jones
 - New version for RichPIDMerge due to package restructuring

! 2004-06-10 - Chris Jones
 - New version for new reconstruction packages :-
   RichDAQ, RichRecBase, RichRecCommon, RichGlobalPID,
   RichLocalPID, RichRecMCTools, RichRecQC and RichRecTools

! 2004-06-07 - Chris Jones
 - Add new MC reconstruction options to allow reconstruction to use MC 
   information for development, debugging etc.

   Available options are listed in options/RecoTooPara.opts :-
   Tracks :-
    1. Use only reconstructed information from TrStoredTracks (default)
    2. Using TrStoredTracks but cheating the tracking information by
       using the associated MCRichTrack. Cheating can be turned on/off for
       individual track algorithm types
   Pixels :-
    1. Use only reconstructed information from RichDigits (default)
    2. Using all RichDigits but cheating the hit position on the HPD window
       using MCRichOpticalPhotons
    3. Uses only reconstructed information (RichDigits) but select only
       true Cherenkov Hits (possibly some issues still be be address here
       regarding the flagging of hits in Gauss)
    4. Using RichDigits but select only true Cherenkov Hits
       and then cheat the hit position using MCRichOpticalPhotons
   Photons :-
    1. Photon reconstruction using full reconstructed information (Default)
    2. Photon reconstruction using full reconstructed information, but
       selecting only true Cherenkov photons using MC information.
    3. Photon reconstruction that uses only true Cherenkov information from
       the MCRichOpticalPhotons (I.e cheat the emission, detection and
       mirror reflection points, and the Cherenkov angles)
