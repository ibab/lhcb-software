!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= RichAlignment v1r12 2015-07-09 ======================
! 2015-07-09 - Paras Naik
 - Changed from 20 bins in phi to 60 bins in phi, for the 2D histograms used 
   in the mirror alignment. Can always rebin later, within the mirror alignment.

!========================= RichAlignment v1r11 2015-06-11 ======================
! 2015-05-23 - Paras Naik
 - Added several TrackSelector cuts in order to remove background photons from 
   our deltaTheta histograms. 

!========================= RichAlignment v1r10p1 2015-04-23 ====================
! 2015-05-23 - Paras Naik
 - Decreased Bins in phi (from 25 to 20) in 2D dThetavphiRec histograms for 
   specific mirror combinations. (Reversed decision of 2011-06-07, see below)

!========================= RichAlignment v1r10 2015-04-21 ======================
! 2015-03-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add some logic to the alignment configurable to extract the correct
   context to use for a given set of tracks from the RichRecSys configurable.

!========================= RichAlignment v1r9 2014-06-10 =======================
! 2014-05-24 - Chris Jones
 - Update various alignment scripts and data files.

! 2014-05-23 - Chris Jones
 - Protect some debug printout behind if statements.

!========================= RichAlignment v1r8p1 2013-04-30 =====================
! 2013-04-09 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add __init__.py to please CMake

!========================= RichAlignment v1r8 2012-11-28 =======================
! 2012-11-26 - Chris Jones
 - Update calibration scripts.

! 2012-11-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

! 2012-10-31 - Matt Coombes
 - Updated line 143 in RichAlignmentEventSelection.cpp as suggested by coverity.
 
!========================= RichAlignment v1r7 2012-07-24 =======================
! 2012-07-13 - Antonis Papanestis
 - Limit the number of photons per HPD when producing NTuples. 
   Number of photons is a property set by default to 10,000

! 2012-07-13 - Chris Jones
 - Add a HPD veto list to AlignmentMonitor

!========================= RichAlignment v1r6 2011-12-15 =======================
! 2011-12-02 - Chris Jones
 - Use long long instead of long

!========================= RichAlignment v1r5 2011-08-31 =======================
! 2011-07-24 - Chris Jones
 - Various improvements to the alignment scripts.

!========================= RichAlignment v1r4 2011-07-27 =======================
! 2011-07-22 - Chris Jones
 - various script improvements 

!========================= RichAlignment v1r3p1 2011-04-27 =====================
! 2011-06-07 - Matt Coombes
 - Changed default Rich1 Histogram ranges from 10mrads to 5mrads
 - Increased Bins in dThetavphiRec plots to help alignment

!========================= RichAlignment v1r3 2011-04-27 =======================
! 2011-04-12 - Chris Jones
 - Fix some bugs in the order of arguments passed to richHisto2D

! 2011-04-08 - Chris Jones
 - Bug fixes to the alignment and calibration scripts, to properly handle
   differences between the CET and GMT timezones.

! 2010-03-31 - Chris Jones
 - Some improvements to the alignment monitor algorithm, to use the RICH 
   methods to book and fill histograms.

!========================= RichAlignment v1r2 2011-04-05 =======================

! 2011-03-10 - Chris Jones
 - Various improvements to the alignment python scripts.

!======================= RichAlignment v1r1p1 2011-02-28 =====================
! 2011-02-25 - Chris Jones
 - Replace boost:lexical_cast<std::string> with std::ostringstream, to appease
   icc11 and coverity
 - Use a map in EventSelection instead of hideously slow  block of string to 
   int if statements ..

! 2011-02-10 - Chris Jones
 - Fix various icc warnings

! 2011-02-08 - Chris Jones
 - Fix various coverity warnings

!========================= RichAlignment v1r1 2010-09-24 =====================
! 2010-09-23 - Chris Jones
 - Some more improvements to the refractive index calibration scripts. Better
   fitting etc.

! 2010-09-06 - Chris Jones
 - Update ganga module to allow jobs to be filtered by 'DataTaking' description
   e.g. Field Up or Down, beam energy etc.

! 2010-09-04 - Chris Jones
 - Update ganga module to allow custom job names
 - Force all ganga calibration jobs to run at LCG.CERN.ch

! 2010-09-03 - Chris Jones
 - More improvements to the calibrations scripts
  + Add pickled run data for all of August
  + Cache resuts of DB look ups for run information for speed. cache is stored
    in a pickled python file.
  + More improvements to the CK theta fit used to extract the n-1 scale factors
  + Add plots showing the CK theta resolution as a function of run number.
  + Show the form of the background contribution to the fit in the output PDFs

! 2010-08-24 - Chris Jones
 - Various improvements to the calibration scripts

! 2010-08-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add a better gauss + pol3 fit for the refractive index calibration

! 2010-08-18 - Chris Jones
