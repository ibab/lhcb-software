!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r11 2015-07-20 ======================
! 2015-06-13 - Chris Jones
 - Improved debug messages, including the inputs for each MVA.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r10 2015-04-21 ======================
! 2015-03-30 - Chris Jones
 - Add some more consistency checks to the NetConfig helper class.
 - Remove redundant status flag boolean data member from NetConfig.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r9 2015-01-14 =======================
! 2015-01-12 - Chris Jones
 - Update default tunes to use MC12TuneV2 for all data types.

! 2015-01-09 - Chris Jones
 - Completely disable the use of NeuroBayes in the requirements and CMake files,
   such that the package no longer links against the NB libraries.
 - Break up TMVAImpFactory.cpp into multiple smaller compilation units.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r8 2014-12-11 =======================
! 2014-12-08 - Chris Jones
 - Add Kaon and Pion networks for the MLP and BDT 'Dev1' (IsMuon as input)
   Bs2MuMu development tunings.

! 2014-12-03 - Chris Jones
 - Remove the out of 0-1 bounds checks for TMVA networks. Not needed for MLP
   MVAs, and breaks with BDTs which vary from -1 to 1 ...
 - Check the 'error' return values from ChargedProtoANNPIDTool to
    -3 : Invalid ProtoParticle or track
    -2 : Failed pre-selection cuts.
   Done in order to avoid using -1, as this is a valid BDT return value.

! 2014-12-02 - Chris Jones
 - Add new developmental PID tunings for Bs2MuMu.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r7 2014-07-14 ===================
! 2014-06-26 - Chris Jones
 - Add support for a new MC12TuneV3 network tune. 
   Default for now is still MC12TuneV2.
 - Add a new tool that provides access to the ANNPID for a given ProtoParticle.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r6 2014-05-13 ===================
! 2014-04-01 - Chris Jones
 - Rework a little the tuple tool, to allow it to be used by a DecayTreeTuple
   tool in DaVinci.

! 2014-03-31 - Chris Jones
 - Add track DOCA variable.
 - Add support for multiple cut text files.

! 2014-03-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add MCVertex information to training tuples.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r5 2014-02-19 ===================
! 2014-01-23 - Michel De Cian
 - Fix behaviour of flag 'fromB' and 'fromD' in ChargedProtoANNPIDTupleTool to only include B and C baryons and mesons, and not particles from string fragmentation of b and c quarks.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r4 2013-10-01 ===================
! 2013-08-12 - Michel De Cian
 - Update ChargedProtoANNPIDTrainingTuple to not terminate the processing if the
   input ProtoParticles are missing. Instead just print a warning.

! 2013-08-12 - Chris Jones
 - Update ChargedProtoANNPIDMoni to not terminate the processing if the
   input ProtoParticles are missing. Instead just print a warning.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r3 2013-07-18 ===================
! 2013-06-04 - Chris Jones
 - Remove unused CheckForNaN.h header causing clang unused method warnings.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r2 2013-06-03 ===================
! 2013-05-30 - Chris Jones
 - Add a specific ANNPID tuning for 2013 data, using "MC12TuneV2".

! 2013-05-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add a short info() level summary printout to ChargedProtoANNPIDAlg, to help
   identify the configuration in use from a log file.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r1 2013-04-30 ===================
! 2012-04-26 - Chris Jones
 - Move the TMVA 'MC12TuneV2' compiled MVA namespace into the ANNGlobalPID
   namespace.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v2r0 2013-04-23 ===================

! 2013-04-17 - Marco Clemencic
 - Ported to CMake the configuration to disable the use of Neurobayes.

! 2013-04-16 - Chris Jones
 - Update the CMT requirements file to only enable Neurobayes on platforms
   that it supports (CMake to follow).
 - Small update to the python configurable for use in the 'on-demand'
   recalibration of the ANNPID in DaVinci.

! 2013-04-15 - Chris Jones
 - Rework the code to compute the input variables to the ANN PID networks,
   to remove the remaining CPU overheads.
 - Remove the use of a full track selector tool, as we are only using it to
   select the correct track type. More efficient to just do it directly.
 - No longer print a warning if the ANNPID is being replaced for a given
   ProtoParticle, as this is normal when applied as a recalibration.
   Also, saves a little more CPU due to the string manipulations that
   where required.

! 2013-04-12 - Chris Jones
 - Add new MC12TuneV2 network tuning :-
  . Based on high statistics training using new MC12 inclusive B samples.
  . Uses TMVA instead of Neurobayes as MVA technology.
   . Gives slightly PID better performance.
   . Much faster implementation due to use of compiled TMVA macros.
  . Config files have now been imported from the Paramfiles package
    ChargedProtoANNPIDParam directly into this package.
  . Dropped support for obsolete tunings (parameters not imported).
    Only MC12TuneV1 and MC12TuneV2 now supported.

! 2013-04-09 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add __init__.py to please CMake

! 2013-04-02 - Chris Jones
 - Add 'FromB' and 'FromD' flags to training tuple.
 - Update ganga scripts to v6 series.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r12 2013-03-22 ==================
! 2013-03-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CMake.

! 2013-03-17 - Paul Szczypka
 - Added "Upgrade" key to NetworkVersions property. New key maps to "MC12TuneV1"
   which is the same as the "2012" key.

! 2013-03-13 - Chris Jones
 - Add a TMVAImpFactory to provide instances of compiled TMVA classifers for known
   configurations. Using compiled classes are roughly 3 times faster than using
	 the corresponding TMVA::Reader implementation with the XML weights file.
   If a compiled instance is not registered with the factory for a particular
   network configuration, the TMVA::Reader implementation is used as the fallback.
   Currently no C++ implementations are included. This will be added once training
   is complete.

! 2013-03-11 - Chris Jones
 - Remove rescaling of the TMVA output value. Not required if EstimatorType=CE
   is used (which looks promising in tests).

! 2013-03-09 - Chris Jones
 - Add support for TMVA based network tunings.
 - Update preselection cut handling to support the new style text file based
   specification the training application now uses.
 - Improve access to the RecSummary data object to prevent multiple loads from
   the TES each event.

! 2013-02-18 - Chris Jones
 - Print some basic statistics of the ANNPID distributions during finalize,
   to help monitor for instabilities in the expert.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r11 2013-02-14 ==================
! 2013-02-01 - Chris Jones
 - Make it possible to turn on or offline the suppression of printout from the
   underlying ANN library (NeuroBayes) via options.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r10 2013-01-30 ==================

! 2012-08-10 - Chris Jones

! 2012-05-02 - Chris Jones
 - Remove context() specific input track locations in
   ChargedProtoANNPIDCommonBase. Default is now the offline location.

!========================= ChargedProtoANNPID v1r6 2012-01-31 ================
! 2012-01-20 - Chris Jones
 - The annoying sporadic stderr messages from NeuroBayes seem to have returned.
   So, until understood squash them entirely by redirecting stderr
   to /dev/null *just* for the m_expert->nb_expert(m_inArray) call.
   Ugly, brutal, but works.

! 2012-01-18 - Chris Jones
 - Update the default network tuning, for all DataTypes, to MC11aTuneV2

   improvements will help in all cases.
 - Add a monitor for the ANN PID variables.

! 2012-01-11 - Chris Jones
 - Reinstate the MC11aV1 tunings, as they have been updated with new network
   tunings, that appear to have removed the spurious printouts ...

! 2011-12-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add default net tunings for DataTypes MC09 and 2008
 - Temporarily switch back to MC10TuneV1 for 2012 and 2011, as the new tunings
   are causing some annoying vogue printouts from the Neurobayes library ....

   releases (10.12 onwards) should suppress the messages from NB when loading
   the expertise files.

! 2010-12-03 - Chris Jones
 - Add python Configurable specifically for the ANN PID
 - Add support for Ghost ID networks
 - Add support for various new ANN input variables
