  . LHCBPS-1425: fix to ensure that the "InitialTime" is stable.
  . LHCBPS-1421: added a first implementation of RunStampCheck service
    o Can be instantiated (via ApplicationManager::ExtSvc) to check if a special
      "run stamp" condition exists for the current run.
    o To ensure that it does get a "current event time", RunStampCheck triggers
      the instantiation of EventClockSvc, so that it is not needed to explicitly
      do it in the configuration.
    o CondDB configurable enables/disables RunStampCheck. It is enabled by
      default for "Offline" (i.e. not Online nor Simulation).

  . Added some documentation for the generation of LoKi Functors caches.
  . Minor improvements to LoKiFunctorsCache.cmake.
  . Added CMake option (LOKI_BUILD_FUNCTOR_CACHE) to turn on/off build of cache
    libraries (ON by default).
  . Modify the functionality to building of C++ cache
    Cache building strategy depends on environment variable
    "LOKI_GENERATE_CPPCODE"
    positive:  number of files
    negative:  number of functors per file
    zero:      single file

- In Phys/LoKiMC v10r18

    ErrorCount property, renamed ErrorCounter in Gaudi v26r2
  . Turbo option in DstConf. Needed for propagation of Turbo objects.

- In GaudiObjDesc v11r23

This version uses Gaudi v26r1 and LCG_74root6 with ROOT 6.02.05.

- Packages modified: DAQ/DAQSys v8r8p1, Det/DDDB v1r75, Det/DetCond v12r41,
    Det/DetDesc v18r37, Det/OTDet v8r16, Det/VeloDet v13r21, Event/DAQEvent v9r18,
    Event/EventPacker v5r1, Event/MCEvent v3r3, Event/RecEvent v2r54,
    Ex/IOExample v4r15, GaudiConf v19r8, GaudiObjDesc v11r22, Hlt/HltDAQ v4r13,
    Kernel/LHCbAlgs v3r5, Kernel/LHCbKernel v15r9, Kernel/LHCbMath v3r56,
    Phys/LoKiCore v11r23, Phys/LoKiHlt v3r20, Phys/LoKiMC v10r17,
    Phys/LoKiNumbers v10r9, Rich/RichKernel v7r59, Tools/CondDBUI v3r33

- In DAQ/DAQSys v8r8p1, v8r8
  . Enabled full L0Muon decoding by default. Fixed decoder-compare test
    accordingly

- In Det/DDDB v1r75
  . Update default database tags to the latest ones:
    o LHCBCOND, 2015                  : cond-20150119-2
    o LHCBCOND,       2013, 2012      : cond-20150119-1
    o LHCBCOND,                   2011: cond-20150119

-In Det/DetCond v12r41
 . Further support for loading CALIBOFF.db file as an additional layer above all
   partitions, for testing purpose only
 . Changed the policy of CondDB::generateXMLCatalog to exclude folders with
   names ending with ".xml" from the generated catalog, fixed QMTests accordingly.
   This is required to allow mixed content in the Online CondDB partition for
   the split Hlt, where the files with ".xml" are not meant to be automatically
   mapped.

- In Det/DetDesc v18r37
  . StaticArray: fix interface of erase to return iterator pointing to the
    first element after the removed one(s), or end (just what std::vector and
    friends do)

- In Det/OTDet v8r16
  . RtRelation: provide constructors which take vector<float>, for the alignment
  . DeOTModule: remove temporary variables, write somewhat leaner code to speed
    up the calculateHits method by another percent or so (shouldn't change the
    results)
  . Follow move from GSL to vdt also in cmt/requirements
  . Speed up findStraws() by factor two by getting rid of the memory allocations;
    also prefer std::min/max/hypot over the GSL variants; no changes in results
  . Remove dependency on GSL, replaced wih vdt

- In Det/VeloDet v13r21
  . Remove dependency on GSL, replaced wih vdt
  . Get rid of gsl_pow_2, just squaring stuff is much much better than a
    function call
  . Use vdt special functions where possible to speed up things

- In Event/DAQEvent v9r18
  . Add HC RawEvent location.

- In Event/EventPacker v5r0, v5r1
  . Update PackParticlesAndVertices to: 
    o Add support for packed Weighted Relations.
    o Add support for custom RichPID objects
    o Make packed RichPID objects key a long long.
    o only traverse the TES once per event to find the data objects to pack.
    o search for and pack weighted ProtoParticle to MCParticle relations.
  . Optimise things a bit for the most likely (recent) packing versions.
  . Add support for the new flags data member in MCParticle.
  . Various small cleanups.
  . Tune a bit better than reserved vector sizes in PackedRecVertex.
  . Add some future proofing packing version checks to packers which had
    versioning added in the last commit.
  . Fix typo in MuonPIDPacker where version 2 was not declared as a known 
    packing version in MuonPIDPacker::unpack
  . Implement 64 bit reference packing for MCParticle, MCVertex and
    TwoProngVertex classes.
  . Add a warning message to reference32 to warn if any code is still creating
    potentially problematic 32 bit packed references. Method is retained for
    backwards compatibility...
  . Add checks for remaining calls to hintAndKey64 for corrupt references
    (should be impossible for 64 bit packing).
  . Add protection to StandardPacker to prevent segmentation faults from a NULL
    pointer dereference in the case of corrupted reference information, due
    to truncation when attempting to pack it to a 32 bit int. Fixes issues
    seen when running over Stripping21 MC samples where some Track references
    in packed ProtoParticles have been corrupted due to data truncation. In 
    these cases the smart refs are now just skipped (so set to NULL).
  . Update the packing of all remaining classes that still use 32 bit reference
    packing to use 64 bit packing. Reading is backwards compatible with old data
    using the packing data version flags. Consequently data written with this
    update can only be read by this version.

- In Event/MCEvent v3r3
  . Add a new bitfield 'flags' data member to the MCParticle class.
    Currently only a single bit is used to define a 'fromSignal' flag that
    indicates if a particle was produced as part of the MC signal decay tree
    or not. Used in MC stripping productions to make sure signal is always 
    saved to uDST streams.

- In Event/RecEvent v2r54
  . Avoid inline virtual methods, move implementations to cpp files.

- In Ex/IOExample v4r15
  . Follow PackParticlesAndVertices packing changes

- In GaudiConf v19r8
  . Add RDST to DstConf. Resurrect RDST, same as DST without RawEvent, only
    for real data Brunel output as alternative to FULL.DST

- In GaudiObjDesc v11r22
  . Update python modules to use logging module instead of plain print.
  . Set the output depending on if VERBOSE environment variable is set or not.
  . Add new option to genClasses.py to generate boost pool allocators with
    threading support disabled. Avoids some mutex lock calls during new/delete 
    that are unneccessary as long as threading is not fully supported.
    New option is the default.
  . Remove the placement operators from the pool allocator definitions.

- In Hlt/HltDAQ v4r13
  . isMuon in full.
  . Extra variables for ProbNNs.
  . Update test to allow for bank version change.
  . Moved to version 4 of sel. reports (in writer and decoder).
  . Full support for RecVertex bank (anticipating PV refitting).
  . Expanded protoparticle bank.
  . HltTrackReportsWriter: Added property (WriteStates) to write or not write out
    states. Default is true to keep the old behaviour.

- In Kernel/LHCbAlgs v3r5
  . QMTest:
    o Condition path changed in the scripts for the Updated DQFLAGS.db
    o Update DQFLAGS.db to remove the xml extension in one of its node paths
  . TrajPoca: polish code and methods a little, speeds up TrajPoca by 7.7%

- In Kernel/LHCbKernel v15r9
  . move count_iterator form Phys/DaVinciTypes 
  . CircleTraj: speed up distTo2ndError by factor 3 (fast cube root)
  . STDataFunctor: avoid call to exp and log from pow, as the exponent is integer

- In Kernel/LHCbMath v3r55, v3r56
  . Minor fixes in Bernstein 
  . use VectorLib to improve Similarity_AVX
  . add running counter 
  . Added timing test for The Similarity functions

  . add one more test
  . Fix a bug in the interaction of the product of Bernstein polynomial and an
    exponential function  
  . Add conversions of polynomial bases  
  . nSphere: use vtd::fast_sincos.
  . Add new header FastRoots.h which implement fast cube and fifth roots and
    their inverses which are accurate to almost the full precision of the
    underlying floating point type, and also a very quick and dirty
    approximation to the hypot function (hypot(x, y) = sqrt(x * x + y * y), the
    approximation of hypot is good to about 4% relative error)
  . Add dependency on pyanalysis  (needed for test_poly.py)

- In Phys/LoKiCore v11r23
  . Functors and Trees:
    o add some "move" constructors/assignements 
    o add swapping methods 
      for decay matching some non-negligible speedup could be expected 
  . ToCpp:
    o extend maximal number of arguments from 7 to (compile-time) infinity 
  . Fix stupid bug in Operations.h
  . Add "FakeSource" , useful for testing, in particular for creation of fake
    streams
  . Add NoEmptyUnion, union of two streamers that is empty if one of inputs is
    empty, and equal to the union of inputs otherwise. 
    Add also 3 and 4-argument variants 

- In Phys/LoKiHlt v3r20
  . HDRFilter : 
    o add two special cases 
      1) Hlt2*Hlt1* name  for filtering of Hlt1 decisions 
      2) stripping case 
    o make default location dependent on the name 
    o Check in initialization consistency of name/code/location 

- In Phys/LoKiMC v10r17
  . Fix typo in the print method 

- In Phys/LoKiNumbers v10r9
  . Add fake source 

- In Rich/RichKernel v7r59
  . Add common option to toolRegistry() method.
  . Suppress info messages about MC Association tool type change from the tool
    registry, as this change is normal and always happens when running on data.
  . Add an additional iteration to the calculation in fast_cbrt.

- In Tools/CondDBUI v3r33
  . Added writeDuplicate argument for method CondDB.storeXMLStringList() which is
    set to True be default. When writeDuplicate is set to False, there will be a
    check on whether the new & old payload contents are identical and only in the
    case of no the new payload contents are saved.

- In Det/DetDesc v18r36
  . SolidTicks: get rid of dynamic memory allocation in RemoveAdjacent
                (this will speed up offline track fit by 3.4%)
  . LVolume, VolumeIntersectionIntervals: reserve space in
    std:vector<Interval> and std::vector<size_t> ("IndexCont"), and move
    allocations out of loops
    (these two changes gain about 0.9% of time in offline track fit)
  . SolidMath: rewrite quadratic equation solver for better numerical
    stability; also regroup/refactor some calculations to save a FLOP or
    two (little impact in time, no change in results)
  . go some way towards pushing StaticArray into the C++11 age
  . New vectorised implementation of MagneticFieldGrid based on the
    VectorClass package.
  . Add new a new data member to MagneticFieldGrid to cache the inverse of
    the step sizes. Allows the replacement of all divisions by multiplications
    (and the removal of one) leading to for instance around an 8% speed 
    improvement in the fieldVector method.

- In Det/FTDet v2r9
  . Fix bug affecting the way the fractional position is used in the light
    sharing for tracks crossing the inter SIpms gaps (at least when this single
    gap size is not an integer multiple of the sipm cell size) : slight increase
    in track reconstruction efficiency after the correction

- In Det/Magnet v7r9
  . Adapt to new vectorised version of MagneticFieldGrid.
  . Fill the new MagneticFieldGrid data member, that caches the inverse of
    the step sizes.
  . Add options to load compensator and LSS magnets.

- In Det/OTDet v8r15
  . RtRelation: reimplement using ChebyshevApprox class to get rid of the large
    lookup tables, the order of ChebyshevApprox is chosen to be of similar
    quality as the fast approximation in WalkRelation (equivalent to about a
    quarter of an OTIS time bin), and the approximation errors of r(t) and
    sigma_r(t) are now of a similar order of magnitude (before, the error made
    in sigma_r(t) was an order of magnitude larger than the one on r(t))
    Also, it uses float internally, as the OTIS does not have the resolution to
    require double precision...
  . DeOTModule: add protection code which monitors accuracy of approximations
    in WalkRelation and RtRelation when they are set/changed; warning
    thresholds are set to the equivalent of half an OTIS time bin (6.5-7.8% of
    OT resolution), and error messages are printed if the accuracy is worse
    than twice that.
  . WalkRelation: use new ChebyshevApprox class from LHCbMath; this should be
    40% faster than the previous code, and is accurate to better than half an
    OTIS bin (i.e. better than about 0.2 ns), more than accurate enough not to
    cause trouble in code using this fast version (this corresponds to about 6
    to 8 % of the OT resolution)
  . Added condition for global t0 of OT

- In Det/RichDet v17r2
  . Use long int instead of just int in DeRichHPDPanel::findHPDColAndPos to 
    avoid FPE's when truncating very large doubles to integer values.
  . Various speed improvements to DeRichHPDPanel (such as removing completely
    an unneccessary virtual function call and dynamic_cast, when getting the
    DeRichHPD object for a given HPD number...).

- In Event/EventPacker v4r7
  . Add support for BCM and BLS hits.

- In Event/FTEvent v1r7
  . Removed 'FTRawCluster', which was not used any more since almost a year
    (replaced by FTLiteCluster)

- In Event/MCEvent v3r2
  . Add BCM and BLS hit locations.

- In GaudiConf v19r7
  . Add BCM, BLS and HC (Herschel) to SimConf.py.
  . Removed a few .qmt files because they were referring to files that have been
    removed by Rob on 2014-01-20.

- In GaudiObjDesc v11r20p1, v11r21
  . Do not call QMTest tests from CMake builds, because all the tests are already
    described in the CMakeLists.txt.

- In HC/HCDAQ v1r2
  . Protect against inserting digits with existing cell IDs.
  . Add PS/SPD bank decoding.

- In Hlt/HltServices v2r7
  . Switch default config access service to CDB.
  . ConfigArchiveAccessSvc (i.e. ConfigTarFileAccessSvc & ConfigZipFileAcessSvc): 
    use old-style format, i.e. use 'str()' directly instead of operator<<
  . Fix query for IP address (lower 16 bits are stored in HltDecReport to
    determine which machine was used)
  . In cmt/requirements, add a dependency to avoid compiling the
    hlttck_cdb_listkeys .cpp files twice in separate threads, that can interfere
    with each other

- In Kernel/HltInterfaces v6r0
  . switch print() to json format, but allow ConfigArchiveAccessSvc access to
    old style format using str()

- In Kernel/LHCbKernel v15r8
  . CircleTraj: speed up the muEstimate method by factor of 3
  . Fix some RICH dictionary warnings.
  . Fix typo: change LHCb::LHCbID::channelIDype -> LHCb::LHCbID::channelIDtype
  . Replace usage of boost with C++11 constructs. 
  . Replace some loops by STL algorithms.
  . Use C++11 to simplify a few things.
  . Fix violation of 'one definition rule' in CaloCellCode
  . MemPoolAlloc: provide pre-C++11 version of commit in v15r7

- In Kernel/LHCbMath v3r54
  . Extend a bit VE-math 
  . Improve printout for WStatEntity 
  . Make flatte amplitude simpler 
  . Add LHCbMath/PolyEval.h, as a substitute for various hand-written or
    library supplied routines (like GSL's poly-eval); the main feature of this
    implementation is a focus on writing C++ code that will map nicely onto
    CPUs with FMA support and unrolling the loop, so the loop counter needs
    checking only every eight coefficients
  . MatrixUtils.h: add Gaudi::Math:inverse   
  . Improve splines, add convex spline
  . Move bernstein polynomials into separate file.
  . Add monithonic and convex polynomials  
  . Add class to calculate fixed order Chebyshev approximations to given
    functions; this class is meant for fast approximations of complicated
    fuctions (prime example is the walk correction in the OT)
  . Ensure that _mm256_zeroupper() is invoked at the boundaries of AVX
    and non-AVX code -- see the discussion in section 12.1 of 
    http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf
  . Add VectorClassTypes.h
  . Add a new test TestXYZTypes
  . Add a new header LHCbMath/EigenTypes.h that contains so wrapper classes
    that make it easier to convert between Gaudi XYZ points and vectors
    and representations based on the Eigen library of vectorised objects.
  . Add a new test application, TestEigenGeometry, to help with testing
    the Eigen package.
  . Add headers for Eigen v3.2.4 library. This is a TEMPORARY measure, awaiting
    correct deployment of Eigen within the LCG Externals area

- In Kernel/XMLSummaryKernel v1r12p1
  . Update tests to use an input file from PRCONFIG (on eos) instead of a private
    castor file

- In L0/L0Muon v9r14
  . Remove unnecessary test on the presence of the RawEvent at a fix location
    which was preventing to run the emulator on dst

    implementations of the mirror finder and ray tracing.
  . Add RichKernel/FastRoots.h that contains various methods for the fast
    calculation of square and cube roots.
  . Various small CPU optimisations.
  . Make the default 'SignalDetEffType' and 'CkResType' tools types in
    Configuration.py for the HLT the same as for Offline.

- In ST/STDAQ v4r6 
  . Extend list of known raw event locations in the decoders to include 
    LHCb::RawEventLocation::Tracker.

    Rich/RichKernel v7r57

- In Associators/MCAssociators v1r5
  . Make code neutral wrt. return type of algMgr->getAlgorithms()

- In Det/DetCond v12r40p1
  . Fix gcc49 unused function warning in DQScanTest.cpp

- In Det/DetDesc v18r35
  . Switch the internal representation of the magnetic field to single precision
    This significantly reduces the memory (and cache) requirements

- In Det/Magnet v7r8
  . Make the MagneticFieldReader code (at source level) independent of the
    internal storage type of the MagneticFieldGrid
  . Speed up the MagneticFieldGrid initialization by _not_ thrashing the
    cache maximally...

- In Det/MuonDet v9r17
  . Reduce the number of local-to-global transformations

- In Det/OTDet v8r14
  . Create separate condition for mono layer alignment in geometry
  . Fix position of wire locators for short modules
  . Modify approximation of 3-segment wire for pattern reco

- In Det/RichDet v17r1

    active) that prevented the reading of the new inactive HPD list from
    the ONLINE partition.

- In Hlt/HltDAQ v4r11, v4r12
  . Add ReportConvert tool (needed for versioning).
  . Fix hltdaq.b_dumpafterreformat test to follow SelReports bank version change
  . Increase SelReport bank version to 3 (for productions with Turbo reports).

- In Kernel/LHCbKernel v15r7
  . MemPoolAlloc: remove pass-through placement new, add template parameters
    which allow one to enable/disable the use of a mutex to 'protect' the
    singleton managing the pool, and set the size of the underlying memory 
    requests. Defaults are such that the behavious is backwards compatible.

- In Kernel/LHCbMath v3r53
  . Fix gcc49 unused function warning in Hesse.cpp
  . Fix gcc49 unused local typedef warning in BSpline.cpp
  . Add vectorized (5x5) -> (5x5) and (5x5) -> (7x7) symmetric matrix
    similarity transforms -- these come in three flavours 'generic',
    'SSE3' and 'AVX'; the relevant version is choosen dynamically
    at runtime, on its first invocation.
  . Add generic & initial AVX version of 'average' used in Kalman Bi-Smoother.
    Generalize dispatcher to be able to deal with both void and non-void functions
  . Cleanup namespace convention & dispatcher, add 'LHCb::Math::Filter'

    identical when done on the various instruction sets (SSE3, AVX).
  . Add test for Similarity_5_7 and 5_1 

- In OT/OTDAQ v7r18
  . OTRawBankDecoder:
    o add option to veto hit pairs in OT for which one hit falls outside the OT
      readoutwindow. Hits outside the time window are discarded. If a hit pair
      in neighbouring straws exists for which both hits are inside the window,
      both hits survive. If one hit is inside and one outside the time window,
      and both hits are either in early, or both are late in the readout
      window, both hits are killed (if vetoing is activated).  In all other
      cases, the hit inside the readout window survives. For now, the default
      is to have this new option disabled.
    o cosmetic change: rewrite the memory management inside the helper classes
      so that one memory allocation is enough (instead of one per module),
      modules are now packed in a consecutive stretch of RAM (which is likely
      helping with caching)

- In Phys/LoKiHlt v3r18
  . Stylistic change of check for turbo bit
  . New HLT_TURBOPASS_RE and HLT_NONTURBOPASS_RE functor.

      in the RunChangeHandlerConditions map.
    o Combine the RunChangeHandlerConditions and XMLFilename properties into a
      single dictionary of filename -> list of conditions so that the 
      RunChangeHandler can be configured to use multiple <subsystem>_<runnr>.xml 
      files.

    DetDesc which only supports signed ints.

- In Kernel/LHCbMath v3r51
  . Functions.cpp: fix stupid typo 
  . BloomFilter: 
    o Be nice and undefine the preprocessor macros which do not have
      the BLOOMFILTER prefix...
    o Replace  template metaprogrammed fixed point log2 by constexpr functions.
      Not done for icc as constexpr is not well supported by that compiler

    are therefore allowed to produce different "sorted" sequences of hits which
    can cause variations in results of client code. the following measures were
    taken to fix that
    o change the increasingBy... functors in TfKernel/RecoFuncs.h so that they
      order by LHCbID as a fallback (i.e. increasingByZ will sort hits at the
      same z by their LHCbID (increasing)); the old behaviour is still
      available through a template parameter which defaults to the new behaviour
   o add corresponding decreasingBy... functors which have the same behaviour
     as their increasingBy... counterparts; they also sort (by default) by
     increasing LHCbID as a fallback

- In FileStager v1r7
  . Move two descriptor mangling functions into a separate library
  . Move source files around.
  . Add hash_particle.exe which outputs the temporary filename used for a given

    decisions. By default lines having not fired are removed. This can be changed
    by setting the option PackDecReport().Filter = False
  . Added a tool to dynamically configure the DataOnDemandSvc using rules (regex)
    to map the destination (requested) path to a source location, and a map of
    source class IDs to conversion algorithms. If a path is recognized as a
    candidate for conversion (e.g. intermediate paths) and the corresponding
    source path points to a plain DataObject, the corresponding node is created.

    XMLSummaryKernel v1r1

- In Calo/CaloInterfaces v8r3
  . ICaloHypoEstimator : fix minor typo

- DAQ/DAQUtils v1r5
  . In daqutils.basictest:
    use GaudiConf.QMTest.LHCbExclusions in validateWithReference

- In Det/DDDB v1r46
  . Update database tags for SQLDDDB v6r14:
    o DDDB,     2011: head-20110722
    o DDDB,     2010: head-20110721

  . Fixed a few Eclipse warnings.
  . Removed CVS keywords.
  . Added the possibility to fetch condition for a range of times instead of

    between the various 'selector' type tools).
  . Update IMCReconstructible interface
  . Extend the IIdealStateCreator interface to use state vector

- In SimComponents v2r3
  . Adapt to new locations of MCInterfaces
  . Follow extension in IMCReconstructible interface

- In TrackInterfaces v3r5
  . Add method to IVeloExpectation to return struct containing r and phi hits
  . Remove const from TrackManipulator interface
  . Add IMaterialLocator interface
  . Extended IMeasurementProvider with 'update' function for a measurement

- In DetDesc v17r4
  . Added temporary files in src/Lib:
    + RotationZYX{.h, .cpp}   : Hacked from homonymous MathCore file in ROOT cvs.
      Describes a 3D rotation transformation about the Z, Y' and X" axes
    + 3DConversions{.h, .cpp} : Hacked from homonymous MathCore file in ROOT
      cvs head. Provides conversions between RotationZYX and other MathCore 3D
      rotation representations.
  . DetDesc/AlignmentCondition.h, src/Lib/AlignmentCondition.cpp
    + Use RotationZYX class internally. At the moment this is messy, as it is
      still not integrated with MathCore. So code will need to be cleaned up when
      RotationZYX classes and co are released in MathCore.

    + Simple standalone functions to convert a misalignment calculated in the
      global frame to the corresponding misalignment in the frame of the parent
      of the detector element in question.
    + These functions are independent of DetDesc and should be put elsewhere,
      but for the time being they rely on src/Lib/3DConversions.h, which will
      disappear when a version of MathCore with a fully integrated
      ROOT::Math::RotationXYZ is released.

    possible. It is also possible to specify only few parameters of the
    condition, and the other are taken from the database.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v20r0>2006-03-10 LHCbSys v20r0</A></H1><PRE>
This version uses Gaudi v18r2 and is the first release for commissioning of the
software for DC06.

It breaks all backward compatibility and introduces many new features, including
a major redesign of event model classes following the review in Autumn 2006,
changes for the 1MHz readout, changes to the geometry to introduce detector
tilts and capability for misalignement, and changes to change replace CLHEP with
MathCore.

All packages have been touched. Please look at release notes of the individual
packages for details.

Many packages have been removed, either because they are obsolete, or because of
repackaging.
