!========================= FTDet v2r9p1 2015-10-12 =========================
! 2015-09-21 - Luigi Del Buono
 - Change DeFTFibremat::CellIDCoordinates from private to public realm (for Violaine Bellee who needs access)
 
! 2015-08-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove #include of obsolete Gaudi headers

!========================= FTDet v2r9 2015-02-23 =========================
! 2015-02-18 - Luigi Del Buono
 - Correct a bug affecting the way the fractional position is used in the light sharing for
  tracks crossing the inter SIpms gaps (at least when this single gap size is not an integer
  multiple of the sipm cell size) : slight increase in track reconstruction efficiency after
  the correction

!========================= FTDet v2r8 2014-12-11 =========================
  
! 2014-12-04 - Luigi Del Buono
 - change again "CreateDetSegment" to correct for a bug in the z0 computation (could explain at least
 partly the efficiency problems), and also to make this routine less geometry version dependent.

! 2014-11-24 - Luigi Del Buono
 - go back to ClassID=8604 for "DeFTLayer" class (was 8603, bilayer class changed too)
 - split "CalculateHits" : the part validating the Mc hit and computes
  sipm id, etc. has been put in "CalculateSipmInfo" (request from J. Wishahi)
 - The hit validation in "CalculateHits" has changed (now in "CalculateSipmInfo")
   some useless parts are removed, introduction of tolerances for Geant4/Arithmetic inaccuracy
   while testing if a Hit in inside a Volume.
 - "CalculateHits" and "CalculateSipmInfo" now return a StatusCode with a severity info code
  which flags the hit rejection cause (if any). See the test Alg in "src/components" dir to
  see how it works. 
 - Also, correction of a bug in "CalculateHits" (which was never happening in fact...)
 - Inactivate the patch curing the RightHoleAxes inversion, since O.Gruenberg changed the DB
   to alleviate this problem (DB not public yet).
 - Some changes in "DeFTTestAlg"

! 2014-11-06 - Luigi Del Buono
 - correct a bug in "fibreMatMinY" and "fibreMatMaxY": the max and the min were inverted
   (thenks to R. Quagliani for spotting this)

! 2014-11-05 - Luigi Del Buono
 - correct a bug in hit fibre length computation, should affect both v2 and v4 geometry
 - some tests to complete still

! 2014-11-03 - Luigi Del Buono
 - Introduce 1st version of code compatible with geometry v4 (only v42 for now)
 - use new modified database with more user parameters
 - special temporary patch to compensate for axes inversion in Right Hole fibermats
 - changes in "CreateDetSegment" to return ymin and ymax of fibermat (in global frame)
 - some changes also in v2 to avoid using hard coded numbers
 - NOTA BENE : this tag is not completely tested yet

! 2014-10-14 - Sajan Easo
  - Made some cleanup in DeFTDetector for adapting to different geometry versions
  - Made minor modifications to DeFTFibreMat in order to process version 40 of the
    FT geometry without a crash and to read user parameters from xml database.

! 2013-07-12 - Diego Milanes
- Adaptation of the code to new geometry. DRASTIC CHANGES! Detector with more granularity
  and therefore more detailed description implemented. Full set of new classes to describe 
  new detector elements in the database. Backward compatibility intended to be able to run on
  previous detector configuration. Please note version() method of DeFTDetector will be used as 
  main switch for changing throuwithin detector versions. Full description of the new detector 
  almost done and few minor changes to be implemented, also documentation to be improved.

! 2012-09-12 - Marco Clemencic
 - Minor change to simplify translation to CMake.

! 2012-07-25 P. Hopchev
   - Implement light sharing between neighbouring SiPM cells. For this
     purpose added two private methods: lightSharing and createLightSharingChannels.
     The former method implements the light sharing model (in this case it uses
     straight lines between [-0.5, 0] and [0, 0.5]), and the latter deals with
     the combination of the deposits in the neighbouring cells.
   - IMPORTANT: the method 'calculateHits' still fills a vector of FT pairs
     (FTChannelID + scalar), but the meaning of the scalar now is the MC particle
     energy fraction deposited in that channel (before was the fractional position
     of the energy deposit).
   - When checking if an MC hit is inside a layer, in the method 'calculateHits'
     we consider that the beam-pipe hole is a circle instead of a square. 

! 2012-06-19 P. Hopchev
  >>> Modifications addressing the suggestions received from the code review. For details see:
  >>> https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=3&sessionId=1&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=190537

  - In all four det.element .h files change the classID values. Now
    they are 8601 (Detector), 8602 (Station), 8603 (BiLayer) and 8604 (Layer).
    Consequently "this" version of Det/FTDet should be used with Oliver's
    'static_DDDB_FT_v4' or later.
  - In DeFTLayer.h added one sentence to the comments clarifying the
    concept of 'net' cellID
  - In DeFTLayer: pass the argument of method cellUCoordinate by reference
    instead of by value
  - In DeFTLayer: modification of typedef namings to make the code more readable
  - In DeFTLayer.cpp make proper checks for NULL pointers when obtaining the
    layer geometrical limit. Also, added a warning comment that the way we obtain the
    layer geometrical limits is not robust against structural changes in the
    layer xml DDDB 
  - Move the (non-trivial) implementation of the method xAtVerticalBorder from the
    class definition in DeFTLayer.h to DeFTLayer.cpp
  - In DeFTDetector.cpp improve the readability of the methods
    'find{Stations,BiLayer,Layer}' by using a simple 'for' loop instead of
    std::find_if and boost::lambda
  - Change variable names in DeFTDetector and DeFTLayer: aPoint -> point,
    aChan -> channel
  - In DeFTLayer created a simple private method 'createChannel' which encapsulates
    the creation of FTChannelIDs and avoids the repetion of the same code in various
    places. Notably, the method 'calculateHits' becomes 30 lines shorter. 
 
!============ Upgrade detectors code review (2012-06-12) ==================

! 2012-06-06 P. Hopchev
  - Removed the prototype of the method createDetSegment(XYZPoint) from
    the Layer header file (ommission in the previous commit).

! 2012-06-06 P. Hopchev
  - In Layer, added a new member variable for the layer slope dzDy and
    the relevant accessor method.
  - Removed the method which creates a det. segment from a XYZ point
    and simplified the method which creates a det. segment from a
    ChannelID and the fractional position inside it
  - Now the created det. segments have the dyDz slope of the layer
 	
! 2012-06-06 P. Hopchev
  - Modified the Layer initialization to take into account that in the 
    latest version of the xml DDDB the beam-pipe is not a cylinder, but a cone
  - In DeFTDetector.cpp: simlified the code which prints the layer parameters
    during initialize. Now we take the properties by calling the relevant
    methods on the layers, instead of taking them from the xml DDDB.
    Added accessors for the layers min and max z-position.  	
    Also, the printout of the layer properties is now controlled
    by the MsgLevel (printing is done only in DEBUG or more verbose level)

! 2012-06-05 P. Hopchev
  - In DeFTDetector.h, DeFTStation.h, DeFTBiLayer and DeFTLayer.h:
    make more methods public

! 2012-06-01 P. Hopchev
  - In DeFTDetector.h make the method findLayer public to allow access
    to it in the FT digitization

! 2012-06-01 P. Hopchev
  - Change of the public/private policy: now almost all methods and variables
    are private. Exceptions are the constructors, destructors and classID accessors
    in all 4 det element classes (Detector, Station, BiLayer, Layer), and
    the methods 'calculateHits' and 'cellUCoordinate' in Layer.
  - Make the FTDet test alogrithm a friend of Detector and Layer so that it can
    call the private methods
  - In DeFTDetector.h and DeFTLayer.h moved the definitions of the trivial inline
    functions directly into the class definition
  - In Detector and Layer create a single MsgStream object at initialize,
    instead of every time a functions is called. Deallocate the memory by deleting
    the MsgStream object in newly created finalize methods. For now in Station and
    BiLayer we print something only in initialize, so the MsgStream modification
    is not made there.
  - In Layer added public functions to get xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax and z_at_center
    of the layer
  - Now the layerID and the stereoAngle are taken from the xml DDDB (==> requires
    a new version of the FT DDDB) and the relevant data members are set during the
    Layer initialization. Removed the Detector obsolete methods setLayerID and setAngle
  - use "format" instead of "boost::format" for printing the layer properties
 
!========================= First commit to svn (2012-05-31) ==========================

! 2012-05-30 P. Hopchev
  - Now create FTChannels also for non-sensitive cells: it is an invalid
    channel which can be recognized by its non-sense layerID: 15
  - Now consider that the beam-pipe hole is a circle (as it is in the FT xml DDDB)
    and not a square.
  - Modifications to the function which creates a DetectorSegment from an
    FTChannelID
  - Implement the functions nextChannelLeft and nextChannelRight

! 2012-05-29 P. Hopchev
  - Modifications to conform better to the LHCb coding conventions
  - rename directory 'job' to 'options' and add option file to run a test
    algorithm under the Boole environment

! 2012-05-25 P. Hopchev
  - Development of the calculateHits method in DeFTLayer
  - Currently 12 layers are intialized, with the inner ones inside each
    station having stereo angle of +/- 5 degrees

! 2012-05-09 P. Hopchev
First implementation of the package.
  - Adopt the cmt structure of Det/OTDet
  - Create DeFTDetector and DeFTLayer that read the xml geometry description
  - Create DeFTStation and DeFTBiLayer corresponding to the xml structure
    (not really needed or used for now)
  - Create the corresponding xml converters (in directory src/component)
  - Create a test algorithm and tool (in directory src/devel)
