! 2010-09-23 - Chris Jones
 - Update LHCb::WeightsVector packing to store the packed weight as a short 
   int, exploiting the fact it will only ever be in the range 0 to 1

! 2010-09-22 - Chris Jones
 - Add packed data classes for LHCb::WeightsVector class.
 - Fix bugs in the PackedParticle and PackedVertex class, where some smartrefs

   gcc 3.4

! 2010-09-15 - Chris Jones
 - Add a first try at full implementations of the packers for Particles and
   Vertices, for use in the stripping. The packing is not 100% ideal yet, the
   MomCov matrix in the Particle class has room for improvement I think and 
   should be improved before this is put into production, but what is there 
   is OK and enough to start testing against.

!======================== PackedEvent v1r0 2005-06-02 ========================
! 2005-06-02 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Package renamed PackedEvent
 - StandardPacker.h moved to LHCbKernel
 - Changed default locations of packed containers to Event/pSim, Event/pDst

!=========================== Rdst v1r1 2005-05-23 ==========================
! 2005-05-23 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Replace Rdst.opts with UnpackDigi.opts and UnpackDst.opts. Use these options
   to unpack containers packed by Boole and Brunel via DataOnDemandSvc
 - Clear the registry address of containers that have been packed. Ensures that
   programs reading a packed file do not try to load the unpacked containers if
   they exist on an ancestor file.

! 2005-05-20 - Olivier Callot
 - Replace the (*it).linkID() by (*it)->key() when storing references, to 
   avoid problems when the SmartRef is created in the job, i.e. linkID() is 
   not yet defined.

!=========================== Rdst v1r0 2005-05-10 ==========================
! 2005-05-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add default TES locations for Rdst classes
 - Add options/Rdst.opts for Rdst encoding and decoding via DataOnDemandSvc 

! 2005-03-18 - Olivier Callot
 - First attempt. The package has a class ( in Event ) for each container
   one want to compress, a struc describing the data and a DataObject which
   contains a vector of these struct.
  
   The xml directory contains the lcg_dict generation

   The Rdst directory contains a small tool to pack various double to int and
   the reverse, and also to pack-unpack references. This part could probably
   be improved

   The src directory has 3 algorithms per class, to Pack, Unpack and Compare
   each of the containers. The default for unpacking is in a different container
   to allow comparison. That should not be the final version !

   Re-grouping the 3 track classes, and the 3 MC information classes in a single
   algorithm would make less (automatically generated) lines of code.
