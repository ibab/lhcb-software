</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r2>2014-05-19 Analysis v12r2</A></H1><PRE>
New development release, built against Phys v18r2.

- Packages Updated :-
   PyPAW, AnalysisPython, CommonMCParticles, DSTWriters, DecayTreeTuple

- Packages Added :-
   DecayTreeTupleANNPID

In PyPAW :
 . Update cmoparison utilities, add qmtest  
 . Add few utilities for semi-automatic reweighting
 . A few fixes in 2D-fit models. Add qmtest.
 . Improve models, add qmtest.
 . Minor reshuffling of code.
 . Fix "bernstain" and "positive" parameterisation of histograms.

In AnalysisPython :

 . Make use of analytical integrals for 2D non-factorazable models.
 . Make use of analysical integrals.
 . Add qmtest that makes segmentation fault for ROOT6.

In CommonMCParticles :
 . Basics used StdNoPIDs instead of StdAllNoPIDs, This was a problem for charm
   modes. Now fixed. All basics are now StdAllNoPIDs. 

In DSTWriters :
 . microdst.py : Add switch to enable the automatic refitting of PVs for uDST 
                 (useful for WG-productions). Default is "no refit".

In DecayTreeTuple :
 . Overhaul TupleToolSwimmingInfo:
  - Fill 0 TPs for events which were not swum, rather than returning an error code.
  - Tweak logic for dealing with multiple candidates in ExtraLocation.
  - Match composite particles to their TPs by comparing their daughters, rather than
    comparing them directly. Copes better when the same candidate is tagged as both
    flavours.
  - Only write per-(trigger|stripping)-line TP decision branches if there are more
    than one of them (i.e. don't duplicate ..._DEC to ..._DEC_linename if there's
    only one line, as there typically is for the Stripping)
  - Fix typo (?) where one of .._Stripping_nTP and .._Trigger_nTP got duplicated as 
    .._nTP

In AnalysisPython :
 . Add tiny shift in X
 . Add a few decorators for TMinuit&Co
 . Few minor fixes in PyRoUts 
 . Add smearing of the histograms according to the Gaussian resolutions

 . Background category : Improved treatment for non-standard configurations
  . Calorimetric-gamma/gamma conversion : photon is assumed to be a stable 
    final state 
  . Specific treatment for gamma->ee conversion
  . Merged/resolved pi0 issue : merged is a basic particle while resolved have 
    photons daughter - improved treatment

In DecayTreeTuple :
 . Clean up base classes, making things private that have no reason to be protected
 . Rework printout so it uses MsgStream and doesn't send any "\n" characters that
   screw up Message Service indenting.
 . Update various tools to use getIfExists
 . Remove nPVs from TupleToolEventInfo. Implementation would not work on a uDST,
   variable is available from TupleToolRecoStats (where it is better at home anyway)
   in a way that is uDST friendly.

In FlavourTagging and FlavourTaggingChecker :
 . Updated FINAL SSpi calibration for Stripping 17
 . Added SSpi cuts from calibration
 . Added ghost probability
 
In JetAccessories :

 . Upstream tracks with poor momentum measurement are turned to infinitely low momenta
   particle (based on sigma(q/p)/(q/p)) but still kept for vertex association
 . Add option to the Neutral recovery: MinECALE_NeutralRecovery and
   MinHCALE_NeutralRecovery are the minimal remaining energy needed to take into account
   in the neutral recovery (until now was only compared to the sigma E of the cluster
   which was said to be badly evaluated)

In TrackSmearing :
 . Added option to set 2012 data - MC12 tuning, on by default.
   Set Settings to something different than "2012" to switch it off

In LoKiPhysMC :

New Packages : DaVinciTrackRefitting

Updated Packages : MicroDSTAlgorithm, MicroDSTBase, MicroDSTTools,
                   AnalysisPython, DSTWriters, DaVinciMonitors,
                   DecayTreeTuple, JetAccessories, KaliCalo

In DaVinciTrackRefitting :
 . First version of a new package, to collect tools to allow easy
   track refitting on (u)DSTs. Work in progress.

In MicroDSTAlgorithm, MicroDSTBase, MicroDSTTools, DSTWriters
 . Suppress variable superfluous messages in the stripping
 . Remove ProtoParticleDeepCloner. Functionality is now merged with 
   ProtoParticleCloner
 . Add a new base class 'ObjectClonerBase' for all cloning tools.
 . Improve the CaloHypo cloning tool. Cloning of the related Hypos, Digits 
   and Clusters are now options. By default Hypos and Clusters are cloned, but
   digits are not.
 . Improve the CaloClusterCloner cloning tool. Cloning of the Entries is now
   optional (disabled by default).
 . Turn off by default the addition of the 'LHCbID Maps' to stripping uDSTs.
   These where added to support TisTos'ing, but now all the information should
   be availabled from the cloned candidates themselves.
 . Enable packing of the cloned CaloClusters.

In AnalysisPython :
 . PyRoUts: Add intervals and (x,y,z,v)min/max-functions, 
 . Add LASS model for Kpi S-wave scattering 
 . Add phase space functor for 2-from-3 body decyas with orbital momentum

Based on Phys v14r2

Updated Packages : MicroDSTBase, MicroDSTTools, DSTWriters,
                   DaVinciMCTools, DecayTreeTuple, TrackSmearing

In MicroDSTBase, MicroDSTTools, DSTWriters  :
 . Some more improvements to the debug printout in the base classes
 . Small improvements to MicroDSTCommon base class
 . Add an option to the uDST stream element methods to control whether or not
   the packed Track clusters (for refitting) are included or not. Default is
   that they are included. Useful, as they add around 1kb/event to the uDSTs, 
   which are O(10kb/event), so around 10%, so potentially useful to be able to
   disable this for any stream that knows it will never require track refitting.
 . Add support for the packed track clusters on uDST streams.
 . Improve the ProtoParticle cloning to allow for dynamic checking of each
   ProtoParticle, and dependant data objects, to determine if they should be
   cloned or not for the stream in question. If the object resides in a TES
   location known to be completely copied to the stream output (for instance
   the standard reconstruction locations on DSTs) then it is not copied and
   the reference to that original container is kept. Otherwise, the objects
   are fully cloned.
   Fixes the problem on Calibration (and EW) DST streams that create custom 
   Tracks, ProtoParticles that where not being properly handled.

In DecayTreeTuple :
 . Many improvements. See package release notes.

In TrackSmearing :
 . Made MC11/Stripping 17 parameters default

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v8r1>2012-03-01 Analysis v8r1 </A></H1><PRE>

Based on Phys v14r1

Updated Packages : MicroDSTBase, MicroDSTTools, AnalysisPython,
                   DSTWriters, KaliCalo

In MicroDSTTools :
 . Add two new vertex cloners, that explicitly clear the TrackSmartRef vector.
   Needed for uDSTs, where these SmartRefs would refer back to the parent sDST.

In DSTWriters :
 . Use new Veto option in InputCopyStream to not copy to full DSTs the Muon
   RawEvent objects. Only needed by PID mDST, and in the full DSTs only by
   accident...
 . Do not clone PV weights vector for uDSTs.
 . Update the PV related uDST elements to not keep the Track SmartRefVector
 . Add an option to stripDSTStreamConf() to allow a full DST stream to opt
   out of including the full DAQ/RawEvent. Default is to included it.
 . Make the packing of stripping (m)DSTs the default.
 . Make the default configuraition of MicroDSTWriter the same as used in the
   stripping.
 . Support packing of either stream dependant or independant DecReports.

   Particles in the decay tree, not just the head Particles.

- In DaVinciMCTools v10r2
 . Various small improvements to the Background Category tools to mke them
   work better out the box with uDSTs
 . PrintDecayTreeTool.cpp: add a field PPkey to print the protoparticle key
 . Do not return StatusCode::FAILURE (and thus abort processing) just because
   an empty Particle range is found by Particle2BackgroundCategoryRelationsAlg.
   This can happen. Instead print a warning and continue.
 . Protect against (impossible?) infinite loops when recursing the decay tree.

 . Extend TupleToolMCBackgroundInfo to use a list of background category 
   tools. Allows for out-the-box running on both DSTs and uDSTs.
 . Extend TupleToolMCTruth to use a list of MC associators instead of a
   single one. Allows (almost) for out-the-box running on both DSTs and uDSTs.

  Backward incompatible version as far as configuration is concerned. 

 Highlights:

  * Many .opts files removed from all packages. They have been replaced
by .py options or configurables where necessary. (Juan, Patrick)
  - Warning : many .opts files still in the release (especially in
PhysSel) do not work anymore. Follow this recipe to adapt:

    https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/DaVinciConfigurable

  * New package Phys/AnalysisConf containing the configuration of
analysis and MC packages. Do not call directly, it is used internally in
DaVinci() (Patrick)

  * Migration to new Particle Property service

  * Tools/Stripping : Declared obsolete. Kept for backward-compatibility.

  * Tutorial/Analysis : Adpated to DaVinci v22r0.

 - Based on LHCb v26r0 and Gaudi v20r3

 - Highlights:

 * Phys/FlavourTagging
  - Changed NNet to make them more gaussian
  - introduced TMVA machinery selectable by option 
  - introduced new CombinedPID for taggers

 * Various bug-fixes.

 * Changes to DVAlgorithm and PhysDesktop behaviour. Extract from Phys v7r3 release notes:
   - PhysDesktop
    . Desktop now uses new IOnOfflineTool and it's own IRelatedPVFinder.
      Defaults for IRelatedPVFinder and IDistanceCalculator are now "".
      In this case, IOnOfflineTool is in charge of getting the type name
      of the implementation of these two. A similar logic applies to the 
      location of primary vertices.
    . Add property P2PVInputLocations, vector of strings with TES locations of
      Particle* -> VertexBase* relations. The PhysDesktop now can take 
      user-defined P->PV relations tables. These over-write relations loaded
      from the default location InputLocations + "/Particle2Vertices".
    . When dealing with Particles and PVs, users should now use the relations
      and not the primaryVertices() method directly.
    . Output location no longer fixed to "Phys/AlgName". Now taken from IOnOffline::trunkOnTES() method. Default" "Hlt/AlgName" and "Phys/AlgName" for on and off-line respectively.
    . Input locations now deduced from context if AlgName not preceded by a "/":
      "MyBsSelection" becomes "Phys/MyBsSelection" or "Hlt/MyBsSelection" in off/online context
      "Phys/MyBsSelection" stays the same regardless of context.

 * Ex/MicroDSTExample:
   - Improvements to MicroDST making python script, addition of python helper modules to aid in reading of DST and MicroDST, improvement to MicroDST reading script.

    the LHCb::ProtoParticles related to them and all their daughters and 
    outgoing particles. Internally it uses an implementation of 
    ICloneProtoParticle, set by default to ProtoParticleCloner.

 - src/CopyProtoParticles{.h, .cpp}
  . Change logic. Algorithm now takes all ProtoParticles in InputLocation and 
    clones them. Internally it now uses an implementation of

  at: http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=16399
- SVertexTool.cpp
   - Put polynomial parameters in DeclareProperty
   - Restore "TDR" polynomials functions from M. Musy and M. Calvi used in
     the opposite inclusive vertex reconstruction (likelihood)
   - All taggers are kept in the vertex reconstruction, including muons which
     where previously removed
   - The upstream tracks are included
   - The Lambda0 mass window is tighten from 1.01-1.2 to 1.112-1.12
   - Apply track quality Chi2 cut on all tracks :
     - chi2(long tracks)<2.5
     - chi2(upstream tracks)<5
           Cuts identical to Opposite Kaon ones, not re-optimized
- TaggerVertexChargeTool.cpp
   - Re-optimization done on DC06 Bs2DsPi phys-lumi2 data
   - The value of m_PowerK and m_AverageOmega cuts have been re-optimized
   - Update the polynomial fonction giving mistag = f(Qvtx) m_P0, m_P1
   - Add in declareProperty: m_wSameSign2 and m_wSameSignMoreThan2. They are
     the mistag fraction of Qvtx tagger in case of 2 (>2) tracks with
     same sign.
   - If estimated omega > 0.5, decision is reversed and omega = 1-omega
- All Taggers:
   - If NNet output is < 0.5, reverse omega and decision.
- BTaggingTool.cpp
   - TaggerVertexChargeTool is called only when no OS (e,m,k) are present. 
     Veto can be overwritten if property UseVtxChargeWithOS is set to true. 
     In this case TaggerVertexChargeTool is called with a vector of particles 
     which excludes the taggers. 
   - call to SVertexTool moved inside TaggerVertexChargeTool.

!========================== DaVinciMCTools v9r4 2007-07-31 ===================

! 2007-07-25 - Juan Palacios
 - Add FilterMCParticleArrayByDecay
   . An implementation of IMCParticleArrayFilter that uses a 
     decay descriptor to select MCParticles coming from a decay 
     from within an array of MCParticles.
   . First implementation, incomplete, untested, and lacking in 
     doxygen documentation.


! 2007-07-24 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - TrueMCFilterCiterion: Call MCDecayFinder only once per event and not
   once per Particle. Store temporary information. Gains a factor O(10) in timing
   for simple decay descriptors. More for complex ones.
   Also added the possibility no give non-standard MCParticle location as input
	 and an optional warning if the decay is not found in the event.

! 2007-07-17 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Removed _load file

!======================== MicroDST v1r0 2007-05-26 ====================

! 2007-05-26 - Juan PALACIOS
  - remove src/MicroDST_load.cpp

! 2007-05-22 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - comment out POOL catalogue in example options file to create MicroDST

! 2007-05-17 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - add a counter to CreateMicroDSTAlg how many 
   particles in the input location (e.g. B cand)
   were stored (not including the daughters, etc)


! 2007-05-10 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - add options file DVCreateMicroDSTExample.opts
   creating a microDST for Bs->J/psi Phi using one
   file from the tracking group


! 2007-05-10 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Rename test.opts into DVTestMicroDST.opts to follow the
   unwritten rule that main DaVinci option files are called
   DV*.opts 

! 2007-04-19 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - add /Event/MC header to microDST

! 2007-04-19 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - add /Event/Rec header to microDST

! 2007-04-13 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - also write mother of MC particle to microDST
 - encapsulate execution of composite associator 
   in try{} catch(...){} to avoid incident manager
   ending the algorithm in TestDST.cpp 
   (not a bug!)

! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - treat endVertex()->outgoingParticles() and daughters() 
   separately in CreateMicroDstAlg.cpp

! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - change in accordance with DaVinci v19r0:
      DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h
   moved to
      Kernel/Particle2MCLinker.h
  for TestDST.h, CreateMicroDstMCAlg.h

! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - change Warning() into debug() if storing user-created
   primary vertex failed - most likely, it hadn't been created
   by the user


! 2007-04-12 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - in TestDST: print some track-related information,
   move information about daughter into 'PrintParticleInfo'
   to descent the whole chain

! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - assume rootOnTes() ends with a "/", edit TestDST accordingly


! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - remove from microDST.opt
   DSTStream.OptItemList      = {"/Event/Link/Rec/Track/Best#1"};



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - CreateMicroDSTAlg
  change sub-routine "StoreParticle" from StatusCode ... to LHCb::Particle *...
  returning clone of the particle passed as argument.
  Makes the handling of checking whether the daughters are already in the TES
  easier als the check in now done only inside at the beginning of this routine
  (and not also in another time when considering the daughters)



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - CreateMicroDSTMCAlg
   new templated function StoreLink to store a link between
   the cloned object and corresponding MC particle



! 2007-02-21 - Ulrich Kerzel

 - CreateMicroDSTAlg
   clone/store calorimeter information accessed via proto-particle
   or set SmartRef (default) depending on alg.-property
   Some Calorimeter information is accessible via extraInfo in
   the proto-particle itself, thus by default just store SmartRef

-  TestDST
   put loops into smaller sub-routines

- CreateMicroDSTMCAlg
  initial revision - not yet to be used for physics analyses
  - clone and store all directly associated particles/vertices
  - do not follow all links up and down the chain of the particles/vertices
    involved: would copy over many objects -> set SmartRef instead and
    have property in case the user wants it


! 2007-02-16 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - let PhysDesktop handle all input locations
   -> fixes issue with relatedPV() when creating microDST
 - write linker table for particle -> PV to
   /Event/Link/<prefix=microDST>/LHCb::RecVertex::Primary

! 2007-02-15 - Ulrich Kerzel
 - initial revision of MicroDST package.
   Its purpose is to write out all "interesting" B candidates, etc. selected
   by the user into a new DST file which allows then much faster re-analysis
   do to its significant smaller size focus on only the few quantities of
   interest. SmartRefs to the orignial DSTs are preserved, i.e. no information
   is lost.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v1r0>2007-03-09 Analysis v1r0 </A></H1><PRE>
Phys split into Phys and Analysis. Phys contains everything 
needed by the HLT and by DaVinci and nothing else. 

All the rest goes into Analysis: MC tools, physics selections, LoKi. Some
packages might be moved to Phys if they are needed by the HLT.

! 2007-02-23 - Chris Jones
 - Minor change to how the Standard Particle DoD sequences are set up
  + For each Data-On-Demand entry alter the configuration to run
    instead of the required algorithm, a GaudiSequencer.
  + By default this GaudiSequencer runs only the original algorithm so
    there is no change to the functionality. The reason for this change is it
    allows other algorithms to optionally be appended to the end of the
    sequencer.
  + A new option file is added 'EnableStandardParticleMonitors.opts' which for each
		of the standard particle sequences appends a monitor algorithm that produces some
    basic performance monitoring.
