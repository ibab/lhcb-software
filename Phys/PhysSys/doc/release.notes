  . Removed unused class rules producing warnings in genflex.

- In Phys/LoKiFitters v4r15 :
  . PVReFitter: duplicate property "MinChi2Iterations" corrected to a new name

  . ChargedParticleMakerBase: Ensure that Downstream and T-tracks use the state at
    first measurement to fill the particle. This behaviour reflects that at the end of Brunel,
    the state closest to beam is removed for these track types.

 . Added RelInfoVertexIsolationDetached tool, which implements the same algorithm as 
   the old TupleToolVtxIsoln (before it moved to use VertexIsolation from ExtraInfoTools). 
   The treatment of decays with secondary detached vertices should be more correct. 
 . Added the parameter "TracksLocation" for RelInfoConeVariables. 
   By default (""), all best tracks from the event are used, but it can be set to e.g.
   "/Event/Phys/StdNoPIDsPions" to use only detached tracks for cones. 
 . Small bugfix in RelInfoVertexIsolation to take into account fits with chi2 == -1
 . Small modification of AddRelatedInfo: do not count element of InfoLocations list 
   if the map returned by the tool is empty. 
 . Modify behaviour of AddRelatedInfo: 
    * Instead of ParticleLocation:RelatedInfoLocation map for InfoLocations property, 
      it takes the map ParticleLocation:vector<RelatedInfoLocations>, where each element 
      of the vector corresponds to the unique particle from ParticleLocation in the 
      decay tree (e.g. for Bs->MuMu need to specify two RelatedInfoLocations, 
      tau->mu+mu-mu- - tree)
    * RelatedInfo is related from the B candidate rather than from daughter particle.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v17r1>2013-08-01 Phys v17r1 </A></H1><PRE>
Development release, based on Rec v15r1, LHCb v36r1 and Gaudi v23r9.

- Packages Updated :
   SelectionLine, DaVinciInterfaces, DaVinciKernel, DaVinciMCKernel,
   DecayTreeFitter, LoKiArrayFunctors, ParticleMaker

- Temporary (bug fix) packages :
   TrackMonitors

In SelectionLine :
 . Protect timing histograms against log(dt=0) entires. If the line
   finishes quicker than the timing resolution of the system call 
   (1mus) then the lowest bin of the histo is filled. task #44041

In DaVinciInterfaces :
 . Change in ITagger.h interface :-
    std::vector<const Vertex*>& allVtx --> int nPV   
 . Added IParticleDictTool which is the basic interface for the new 
   dictionary tools in LoKi.

In DaVinciMCKernel :
 . Particle2MCAssociatorBase : Fix access to MCParticles when 
   RootInTES is set.

In DecayTreeFitter :
 . Small fix in configuration to make sure that 'unfitted' vertices 
   will not be reused.

In LoKiArrayFunctors :
 . Added Dictionary Tools :-			
  + MultiToolDictTool implements the same functionality as the 
    Hybrid::TupleTool but it writes the evaluated functors into the 
    dictionary instead of the ntuple.
  + Dict2TupleTool can write a Dict into the ntuple
  + DictTransformTool is a template class that provides the 
    infrastructure to implement arbitrary transformations on dictionaries. 
    Transformations such as MVAClassifiers have to implement the 
    corresponding policy as demonstrated in DummyTransform.cpp 

In TrackMonitors :
 . Fix uninitialized variable in ConfiguredTrackMonitors.
 . Run all monitors if the LHCbApp property isn't set.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v17r0>2013-06-13 Phys v17r0 </A></H1><PRE>
Development release, based on Rec v15r0, LHCb v36r0 and Gaudi v23r8.

- Packages Updated :
   SelectionLine, DaVinciTools, DaVinciTransporter, DaVinciTypes,
   DecayTreeFitter, KalmanFilter, LoKiFitters, LoKiJets, LoKiPhys, 
   LoKiProtoParticles, NeuroBayesTools, ParticleMaker, PhysConf,
   TisTosTobbing, Swimming, VertexFit

In DaVinciTransporter :
 . Add some logic on ParticleTransporter constructor for 
   automatic selection of proper track extrapolator.
 . Add new particle transporter:  DaVinci::ParticleTransporter
   It relies on ITrackStateProvider for better treatment of 
   track states.  
   For single use it could be slower, but in case of 
   coherent usage of the same public instance it 
   could be even faster due to smart caching implemented 
   by Wouter in TrackStateProvider tool.
   The treatment of electrons is still not satisfactory,
   some fixes in BremmAdder are needed for proper treatment [todo].

In DecayTreeFitter :
 . Fixed bug in initialization of decay length.
 . Improved initialization of momentum for particles with mass constraint.
 . Improved identification of poorly converging fits.
 . Changed convergence criterion to a relative change in chisq 
   (rather than absolute change).

In KalmanFilter :
 . Add a variant of "load" method with an explicit particle type.

In LoKiFitters :
 . VertexFitter:
   + Add some functionality to improve fits with downstream tracks,
     in particular allow the use of new ParticleTransporter. 
   + Use a little bit different logic for seeding.
   + Redefine the fiducial volume for seeding.
 . Fix a "feature" in chi2(doca) calculations.
 . Fix a bug with particle classification.
   Essentially all calculation of DOCACHI2 with 
   participation of K0S was wrong.
   Many thanks to Matt Reid for reporting the problem.

In LoKiPhys :
 . (Re)Enable very important error message for IDistanceCalculator::distance.

In NeuroBayesTools :
 . Properly initalise all data members in NBB2HHTriggerTool 
   (Coverity UNINT_CTOR)

In PhysConf :
 . Do not force verbose printout from DataOnDemandSvc. If a user wants 
   this, they should activate it themselves...

   possibility of tertiary vertices, e.g. in B->DPi, D->3h.
 . Rewrite code which calculates the number of VELO hits on a track to take
   into account more details of the VELO geometry, for example tracks
   crossing the VELO halves, or tracks starting outside the VELO and going back in.

- Based on LHCb v31r8 and Gaudi v21r11. Post-stripping12 development version.

 * DVAlgorithm:
   . Now understands full InputLocations, i.e. ending with "/Particles".
   . No more BlindVertexFitter.
 * DaVinciTools:
     CheckSelResult has Notmode.
 * DecayTreeFitter:
   . Revive functionality to reuse existing vertices (forceFitAll=False)
   . Add functionality to get chi2 of part of the tree
   . Reduce verbosity for failed fits
 * New package Phys/KalmanFilter
   . Kalman filter based vertex fitting.
 * LoKiFitters
   . DistanceCalculators: add methods for IP-vector
   . Kalman filters moved to Phys/KalmanFilter
   . Add branches for 3 and 4 body decays
   . Untested proper treatment of di-gamma-like particles
   . BlindVertexFitter removed.
 * Many new LoKi functor symbols.
   . See Phys/LoKiPhys, Phys/LoKiProtoParticles release notes.
 * Selection toolkit
   . Selection output locations now include "/Particles" by default, i.e. 
     set for use with DVAlgorithms.
   . Extension constructor argument in Selection, AutomaticData allows
     to change it from "/Particles" to something else.
   . Selection class has InputDataSetter constructor argument to specify
     method used to set input data of underlying algorithm. Default is 
     'IputLocations', i.e. for use with DVAlgorithms.
   . New selection type VoidEventSelection, makes a LoKi__VoidFilter and
     replaces "<Location>" in Code argument by location of the required
     selection. Allows to set up event selections based on contents of
     output location of any selection type. Exports input location as
     outputLocation, so it looks like a plain selection and can be chained 
     together.
 * TisTosTobbing
   . Important bug fixes for L0 reports makers letting intermediate channels 
     act as decisions
   . Important bug fix for reading TisTos information from stripping MicorDSTs
 * Vertex re-fitting
   . Added experimental PVTrackRemover, an IPVReFitter that uses 
     IPVOfflineTool's method to remove the weighted contribution of the set 
     of tracks making a particle from the PV. TEMPORARY AND ONLY FOR TESTING!

     selection-like objects into selections with an output location completely 
     bound to a new name. Needed for stripping, where the stripping line is 
     created from a selection
     object.
     Added modules PhysSelPython.SaneConfigurables and PhysSelPython.__sanity__
     with code necessary to create safe Configurables and replace them for 
     their unsafe counterparts in the Configurables module. Replaces or 
     modifies most configurables used in typical physics analysis and/or
     stripping. Two distinct cases:
     1) Replace all configurables of interest in Configurables module:
              from PhysSelPython import __sanity__
              from Configurables import X # X is safe version
     2) Create configurable module SaneConfigurables with safe versions of
        configurables of interest
              from PhysSelPython import SaneConfigurables
              from SaneConfigurables import X # X is safe version of Configurables.X

    . Fix bug in evaluation of impact parameter Chi2 in DistanceCalculator 
      and TrgDistanceCalculator.

  * New Particle->PV relating functionality in DaVinciTools: 
    . New PVRelatorAlg GaudiAlgorithm. Takes either Particle and PV TES 
      locations, or Particle->PV relations table TES location as input, runs
      an IRelatedPVFinder to get weighted, sorted relations between Particles
      and vetrices, and produces a new relations table that is places on the
      TES. It allows to re-run some best PV finding logic on already stored
      Particles and Vertices, or to re-sort existing relaitons according to 
      some new "best PV" logic.

! 2008-11-25 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - Adapt doxygen to no version directories.

! 2008-10-29 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - DecodeRawEvents.opts -> .py

 * Phys/VertexFit
  - PVReFitterAlg: Bug fixes. Add bool properties UseIPVOfflineTool(false) and UseIPVReFitter(true) determining if the PV re-fitting tools should be used.
  
 * Phys/DaVinciTools
   - OnOfflineTool
    . Conform to changes in IOnOffline interface. Interface now only returns
      strings with names of PV location or some tools, depenting on context.
      It no longer holds any tools of its own.

   - Related or "best"PV finding overhaul
   . Conform to new IRelatedPVFinder interface
   . No configuration beyond that of GaudiTool. All configuration at compile-time
   . RelatedPVFinder replaced by template GenericParticle2PVRelator with implementations (typedefs) for on and off-line, IP and IP Chi2

   - PhysDesktop
    . Desktop now uses new IOnOfflineTool and it's own IRelatedPVFinder.
      Defaults for IRelatedPVFinder and IDistanceCalculator are now "".
      In this case, IOnOfflineTool is in charge of getting the type name
      of the implementation of these two. A similar logic applies to the 
      location of primary vertices.
    . Add property P2PVInputLocations, vector of strings with TES locations of
      Particle* -> VertexBase* relations. The PhysDesktop now can take 
      user-defined P->PV relations tables. These over-write relations loaded
      from the default location InputLocations + "/Particle2Vertices".
    . When dealing with Particles and PVs, users should now use the relations
      and not the primaryVertices() method directly.
    . Output location no longer fixed to "Phys/AlgName". Now taken from IOnOffline::trunkOnTES() method. Default" "Hlt/AlgName" and "Phys/AlgName" for on and off-line respectively.
    . Input locations now deduced from context if AlgName not preceded by a "/":
      "MyBsSelection" becomes "Phys/MyBsSelection" or "Hlt/MyBsSelection" in off/online context
      "Phys/MyBsSelection" stays the same regardless of context.

   - Python
    Add modules /DaVinciTools/Conf.py and DaVinciTools/Tools.py with configurables and short-cuts for templates GenericParticle2PVRelator specialisations. Allosw for easy configuration and instantiation in GaudiPython.

 - Default behaviour is for real data stripping, using LoKi tools and IDistanceCalculator
   . See http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=33039
 - Backward compatibility with DC06 is maintained but not mainstream.
   . IGeomDispCalculator interface now obsolete, but can still be used for backward compatibility
   . The related PV is now set using IDistanceCalculator, which can lead to some differences
     with previous versions.
 - Default tool for FilterDesktop is now LoKi::Hybrid::FilterCriterion.
   . To get the previous behaviour do

FilterDesktop.FilterCriterion = "ByPIDFilterCriterion" ;// not default anymore

! 2008-04-17 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - PhysDesktop: the save(X) method is now called keep(X) to make it clearer.

! 2008-04-16 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - PhysDesktop: 
   . Completey remove the std::set of Particles in TES. This can be found
     from parent()
   . Rename save() to putOnDesktop(). save is kept for bacward compatibility for
     some time.

! 2008-04-16 - Patrick Koppenburg
 - PhysDesktop:
   . Bug fix: daughters of input particles were saved along with mother when
     saveDesktop() was called. Example: a Bs->j/psi phi LoKi_CombineParticles
     would save the Bs, the two mus and and the two K's in the TES.
     -> the effective change is to add all particles with 0!=P->parent() 
       to the list of particles already in the TES.
   . rename methods inDesktop and setInDesktop to inTES() and
     setInTES(). 
   . new method printOut that prints out in verbse mode.

 the desktop of the parent DVAlgorithm and on writer that is only
 to be used by the PhysDesktop
 - Kernel/IRelatedPVFinder.h
   . New interface for a tool that finds related PV according to some criteria
     only method: 
        StatusCode relatedPVs(const LHCb::Particle* p,

  - DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h
  . Fix some typos in Object2FromMC constructors.

  EXPERIMENTAL VERSION

  Major changes so Particle2MCLinker implementation.
  Linkers are now type-safe. For reverse-association to work, it is necessary
  that the Object2MCLinker class knows the SOURCE (typically Particle or 
  ProtoParticle) for links with key. Previously it was treating everything as 
  KeyedObject<int>. As a result:

  1. class Object2MClinker 

     is now 

     template <class SOURCE=LHCb::Particle> 
     class Object2MCLinker

  2. template <class OBJ2MCP=LHCb::Particle> 
     class Object2FromMC : public Object2MCLinker

     is now

     template <class OBJ2MCP=LHCb::Particle>
     class Object2FromMC : public Object2MCLinker<OBJ2MCP>

  3. implementation file src/Lib/Particle2MCLinker.cpp now is templated so is
     moved to DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.icpp and included in 
     DaVinciAssociators/Particle2MCLinker.h

  4. There is no linker library now.

    The typedefs Particle2MCLinker and ProtoParticle2MCLinker retain ther 
    old meaning:

    typedef Object2FromMC<LHCb::ProtoParticle> ProtoParticle2MCLinker;
    typedef Object2FromMC<>                    Particle2MCLinker;

!========================== DaVinciKernel v5r2 2006-10-04 ===================

! 2006-10-03 - Juan PALACIOS
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . Fix compilation errors with last two changes.

! 2006-10-03 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . Issue "No relations table" warning only 10 times
! 2006-10-03 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . No particles on TES is not an error. Issue 10x a warning instead.
! 2006-09-18 - P. Koppenburg
  - Kernel/IContextTool.h
    . New user-friendly interface to IOnOffline tool that should not be used
      in user code anymore. This tool has methods:
  /// Get primary vertices
  virtual LHCb::RecVertex::ConstVector primaryVertices() const = 0 ;
  /// Get geom tool
  virtual const IGeomDispCalculator* geomTool() const = 0 ;
  /// Get default vertex fitter
  virtual const IVertexFit* vertexFitter() const = 0 ;
  /// Get physDesktop if available
  virtual IPhysDesktop* desktop() const = 0 ;

  It first tries to get them from the parent DVAlgorithm and if it 
  can't interrogates the OnOffline tool. This allows more coherence
  of tools within a given DVAlgorithm and sub-tools since all is 
  defined localy by the DVAlgorithm.

! 2006-09-14 - P. Koppenburg
  Added new automatic particle-to-PV association features making use of
  Juan's new table (see 08-21)
 
  - Kernel/IRelatedPV.h
    . New tool that gets the PVs associated to a particle. Allows
      to build the association table if not there. 
      This tool actually accesses the desktop of the ancestor DVAlgorithm.
      Any use from ToolSvc or from a non-DVAlgorithm will get a Failure.

  - Kernel/FilterCriterionBase.h
  - src/Lib/FilterCriterionBase.cpp
    . Provide a pointer to IRelatedPV for all FilterCriteria

  - Kernel/IPhysDesktop.h
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.h
    . cloneTrees method needs to clone the association table too. 
      -> requires it not to be const.
    . new private method getRelations()
    . inDesktop() becomes const
    . saveTable changes signature
  
! 2006-09-12 - P. Koppenburg
  - Kernel/IPhysDesktop.h
    . Change signature of relate to accept defualt value 1 for weight 
  - src/component/ PhysDesktop.h
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . Bug fix: inline methods i_p2PVTable() returned a copy of the table
      and hence all attempts to modify it were fruitless. 
      Now return a pointer. Changed code accordingly.

! 2006-09-06 - Olivier Deschamps
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . update for DC06 Calo stuff

! 2006-08-22 - Juan PALACIOS

  - Kernel/IParticle2VertexAsct.h
    . Completely changed interface. Now returns a weight (double) relating
      a Vertex to a Particle.

  - src/component/Particle2VertexIPSAsct{.h, .cpp}
    . Completely modified to adapt to new IParticle2VertexAsct.h interface.

  - Clean up IPhysDesktop interface. Remove internal methods. Make most 
    methods const.

  - Replace references to Particle2Vertex::Weight in public interface of 
    IPhysDesktop and implementations by double for clarity.

! 2006-08-21 - Juan PALACIOS
  - src/component/PhysDesktop.cpp
    . Add implementations for methods concerning relations of LHCb::Particles
      with LHCb::VertexBases.

! 2006-08-18 - Juan PALACIOS
  - Kernel/PP2MCLocation.h
    . New namespace containing locations of relations tables between charged 
      and neutral ProtoParticles and MC. New locations are:

      LHCb::ProtoParticle2MCLocation::Charged 
        ( = "Relations/" + LHCb::ProtoParticleLocation::Charged )
      LHCb::ProtoParticle2MCLocation::Neutrals
        ( = "Relations/" + LHCb::ProtoParticleLocation::Neutrals )

! 2006-08-17 - Juan PALACIOS
  - Kernel/IPhysDesktop
    . Add public methods for relating and retrieving relations between 
      LHCb::Particles and LHCb::VertexBases.
  - src/component/PhysDesktop{.h, .cpp} 
    . Add dummy implementations for the above.
  - Added: Kernel/Particle2Vertex.h
    . Namespace containing typedefs for LHCb::Particle -> LHCb::VertexBase 
      one-directional weighted relation.

! 2006-08-16 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - src/Lib/DVAlgorithm.cpp
   fix a misprint "ParticleCombiner" ---> "ParticleCombiners" in the name of 
   the property 

! 2006-08-16 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - Kernel/DVAlgorithm.h, 
   src/Lib/DVAlgorithm.cpp

     fixes to utilize the access to basic DaVinci tools "by-name": 
   
     // default 
     IVertexFit* fitter1 = verterFitter()
     // the same 
     IVertexFit* fitter2 = verterFitter("")
     // "offline"
     IVertexFit* fitter3 = verterFitter("Offline")
     // "trigger"
     IVertexFit* fitter4 = verterFitter("Trigger")

   The mapping "nickname --> the actual type/name" is done through the 
   algorithm properties, e.g.
   
    MyAlg.VertexFitters =  { 
        "Offline" : "OfflineVertexFitter" , 
        "Trigger" : "TrgVertexFitter"     , 
        "Kalman"  : "BlindVertexFitter"   } ; 

    It is done for following tools:
      1) IVertexFit
      2) IGeomDispCalculator 
      3) IParticleFilter 
      4) IFilterCriterion 
      5) IParticleCombiner 
      6) IParticleReFitter 

    The default defined mapping is:

  The defualt values ("") for IVertexFitter and IGeomDispCalculator are set

    . Restore Christian's tool MCEffReconstructed.
    . Temporarily requires that all charged are within the calo acceptance,
      which is hard coded and have P>1GeV (also hard-coded). 
      Would be nice to call the MC TrackInfo and the geometry service.
  - src/MCParticleMaker.cpp
    . By default require that all Particles are reconstructible

! 2006-05-17 - Juan PALACIOS for Stefania VECCHI	
  - Fixes to MCParticleMaker memory leaks

! 2006-05-05 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/MCParticleMaker.cpp: 
funny bug in MCParticleMaker. It's the line

  double  E = sqrt(px*px + py*py + pz*pz + m*m); 

well, m is not declared, so it takes the Gaudi units variable "m" for meter, 
that has a value of 1000mm. The effect is that all created particles have a 
mass of 1GeV! :-)

! 2006-05-03 - P. Koppenburg
 - DaVinciTools/IVisPrimVertexTool.h

   primary vertices and (primary) MC-vertices and pp-collisions.
  
   The link attribute ("weight") is LHCb::PV2MCWeight, 
     which is std::pair<size_t,float>.
   The first component is  a number of true MC-tracks from the 
   given (primary) vertez, used in the reconstruction of the PrimVertex

  - All packages identical to v1r2, but built against LHCb v16r7
  - Except Hlt: New RICH code and HltMonitor package to ensure
    backward-compatibilty of the three other Hlt packages.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v1r2>2005-06-13 Phys v1r2 - Frozen trigger for RTTC</A></H1><PRE>
  - RTTC: . HLT is frozen to ensure identical results between RTTC and the 
            production of the multi-events packets (MEP).
          . Several monitoring algorithms have been added to the HLT packages
	  . There is an algorithm that allows to write out HltScore into 
	    the raw buffer. For RTTC.
          . The HLT will be run in a new application called Moore
  - Phys: . The IPVLocator tool has been replace by an IOnOffline tool. It
            provides the PV, but also the IGemDispCalculator and the 
	    IVertexFiiter to use. This allows an easy switching between tools
	    in on- and offline environments. The HLT options telling
	    which tool to use have been removed.

!========================== LoKiJets v1r1 2005-06-13 ===================

  KtJets moved to External/

!========================== LoKi v3r13 2005-06-13 ===================
! 2005-06-02 - Vanya BELYAEV
 - LoKi/LoopObj.h
   src/LoopObj.cpp

  New method for changing the particle ID for "loop"-object is introduced
   
  for ( Loop Bc = loop ( "psi pi" , "B_c+" ) ; Bc ; ++Bc ) 
   {
     // set particle ID according to the charge of the pion
      Bc->setPID ( Q( Bc(2) ) > 0 ? "B_c+" : "B_c-" ) ; 
      //
      Bc->save("Bc") ;
   }

  IMPORTANT:
  ==========
  The treatment of setPID method is modified now.
  The particle ID of existing effective particle will 
  be modified (if proper ownership is establshed).
  For some configurations (rare) it could result in 
  deletion and recreation of existing particle object. 
  In this case, the results of various fit procedures 
  could be modified. Therefore *IT IS RECOMMENDED* to 
  use this method *ONLY BEFORE* the  actual explicit 
  constrains procedures, e.g.
  
  correct order: 

      Bc->setPID( ... ) ; 
      Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime) ;  

  "wrong" order: 

     Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime ) ;  
     Bc->setPID( ... ) ;       

   It could be wrong e.g. in the context:

      for ( Bc = loop ("psi pi", "B+") ;  .... ) 
        {
            Bc->fit( FitMassVertex && FitLifeTime ) ;  // WRONG
            Bc->setPID( "B_c+") ;                      // WRONG  
            Bc->save("Bc") ;       
        } 
   Here for the saved object only Vertex-constrained fit is performed.
   (Note the mismatch between "B+" and "B_c+")

   . Mass window can be selected separately for each sub-head for 
     calculating efficiencies.
     The way it is done is elementary. There are four values specified, with 
     default values of 0.05 GeV. These can be modified in DVEff... .opts.
     Of these, as many are activated as needed.
     The variables are m_massSig0, ... m_massSig3. 
     In the case that more than four sub-heads occur, the m_massSig3 value is 
     taken for all the subsequent sub-heads (just for security).
 - options/DVEffBd2DstarPi.opts

    . New property MaxDepth, that allows to control the depth of recursivity
      when FilterByDescendents = true. Works for the case
      Bs -> Ds pi, when on wants to cut on the bachelor pi but not on the
      pi from the Ds (with MaxDepth = 1).
      TODO: Does probably not work with B -> D* D*... but no use-case so far.

! 2005-04-13 - P. Koppenburg for Luis Fernandez
  - src/VtxIsolationFilterCriterion.{cpp,h}
    . Returns a yes/no depending on the number of particles (un)compatible
      with the endVertex of a particle, with some IP or IPS cut or abs difference
      in chi2 between particle and particle and one extra track in the vertex 
 
      It excludes signal particles in the additional tracks or tracks with same origin
      and gammas are ignored
      To be applied on a b-hadron for instance
  
      Example : to reject b-candidates that have more than 
      12 non-signal particles with an IPS < 4 sigmas to the b-vertex
      MyAlg.VtxIsolationFilterCriterion.InputParticles = {"Phys/ParticlesForMyAlgo"};
      MyAlg.VtxIsolationFilterCriterion.IPS = 4;
      MyAlg.VtxIsolationFilterCriterion.NTracks = 12;
      MyAlg.VtxIsolationFilterCriterion.Reject = true; // default
 
      Requirement on IP also possible, typically 0.05 * mm
      Requirement on DeltaChi2 also possible, typically < 9. Warning: time consuming
 
      If Reject is set to false, then only candidates with at least 12 other
      non-signal uncompatible particles will be kept

 - Backwards incompatible fix for new TrgDecision->hlt() accessor name, 
   for GaudiObjDesc v7r*

!========================== TrgVelo v7r2 2005-03-08 ===================
! 2005-03-01 - Olivier Callot
 - Restore the use of 'RSensor' and 'backward' flags of TrgTrack to describe
   how the TrgTrack was made
 - Add a new joboption "PhiFirstTol = 0.05" in VeloSpaceTracking to remove a 
   hardcoded value of .15. Tuned a bit also PhiMatchTol, .20->.10, to increase 
   efficiency.

! 2005-02-11 - David Hutchcroft
 - Added a "new" error matrix calculation based on the old one from VeloTrack
   This has smaller errors reduced the chi2 for Matched track and prevent too
   many matches. The code should certainly be revised in conjunction with a 
   matched tracking chi2 cut retune at some point.
   Use "VeloSpaceTracking.Offline = true;" in the options to use this.
 
! 2005-01-07 - P. Koppenburg
 - src/SpaceTrack.h
   . Do not apply slope-dependent multiple-scattering error, it screws
     up the PV resolution (why?) ``Fixed but not understood''.
<     double MSStep = stepError * m_slope / 0.050 ; // P from Pt for MS estimate
>     double MSStep = stepError ; //* m_slope / 0.050 ; // P from Pt for MS estimate

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r8>2005-03-03 DaVinci v12r8 - Parralel version with v13r0</A></H1><PRE>
Version released in parralel with v13r0 containing a lot of trivial
fixes to accomodate CLHEP 1.9 (used in v13r0, not in this version).

The L1 memory leak has been fixed

But there is still a memory leak in L0Muon. To avoid this, L0Muon
is not run anymore in L0.opts. !WARNING! This will make you use the old
obsolete muon trigger result stored on the DST. So either you get the old L0Muon
or you live with a 20kB memory leak. 

There are some changes in Physics tools:

- The ICheckOverlap tool has been completely revised. It now accepts 
  const inputs. The missing single-particle method has been added. 
  Another new method removeOverlap( ParticleVector& ) removes particles
  with overlap (i.e. typically a B where twice the same track has been used)
  for the vector.
  
- A new OverlapFilterCriterion applies the CheckOverlap tool in a filter.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r7>2005-02-14 DaVinci v12r7 - Hlt development version</A></H1><PRE>
Backward-compatible HLT development version. Based on Gaudi v15r3 with patched 
GaudiPoolDb and LHCb v16r4. Includes LoKi v3r9.

Main Modifications:

    *  On popular demand the PhysDesktop now provides two methods
               const VertexVector& primaryVertices();     // get all PVs
               const VertexVector& secondaryVertices();   // get vertices from InputLocations
            The method
               const VertexVector& vertices();
            is now slower as it uses the above methods, but still exists.
       
    * Updated L1Decision. WARNING: This version gets significantly different
      results from the official stripping version in DV v12r4.
    * Updated flavour tagging, now using the tampering by default.
    * Complete HLT update. Still for experts only.
    * Many modifications in LoKi.
    * Many small changes to prepare for migration to CLHEP 1.9. See details.

    . Removed DaVinciCommon and DaVinciReco already included in 
      DVBTagging.opts

! 2005-01-31 - P. Koppenburg for Marco Musy
Main changes/upgrades are the following:

- tagging efficiencies and performance calculation are now moved
to BTaggingMonitor so that no truth information is accessed at any stage.

- BTagging.cpp still needs to rerun the trigger because it 
makes use of the tampering info

- SecondaryVertex is now a tool, and the user can choose whether
to use the TDR definition or the revised version of it using
NeuralNets (default is old tdr)

- I implemented the new definition of tagging categories, obtained
by using a NNet tuned for each taggers separately. 
these NNets are accessed via a tool (this was asked for in a meeting).
the user can still choose to stick to the old TDR categories via 
BTagging.CombinationTechnique = "TDR";

- summaryof.cpp is an additional standalone program to quickly get 
useful numbers out of the logfiles. it contains the instructions on
how to run it.

- DVBTagging.opts is meant as an example option file.

      mix Vectors and Points in formulae anymore. One cannot easily convert
      one to the others. :-(
    . Make them GaudiTools where not already done.
    . Fix a few compilation warnings.

! 2005-02-08 - P. Koppenburg for Hugo Ruiz

    . New version that accepts intermediate states. Works fine with
      short-lived resonances but not yet well with long-lived like D0.

 - New tuning after VELO-TT bug fix.
                                                                                                                                                          
!========================== TrgCalo v1r0p2 2005-02-15 ===================
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r6>2005-01-19 DaVinci v12r6 - Hlt development version</A></H1><PRE>

  Major Modifications:
  --------------------
  - CombinedParticleMaker:  Set ExclusiveSelection to false by default
     !!! WARNING !!! This is a major change that will change the result
                     of all selections using the CombinedParticleMaker without
		     resetting this options. In particular most stripping
		     preselections use ExclusiveSelection = true ; 

  - All Interfaces are moved from $DAVINCIKERNELROOT/DaVinciTools/
    to $DAVINCIKERNELROOT/Kernel/ for compatibility with LHCb.
    -> Replace all ``DaVinciTools/'' by ``Kernel/'' in all code.
    The DaVinciTools/ directory is still there as long as there is some code
    not yet adapted and contains dummy files including the proper file.
    
  - New doxygen style using dogygen 1.5. The main "feature" is that now
    classes taken from LHCb and Gaudi are linked to and not included.
    A disadvantage is that they do not appear in the alphabetical list
    anymore. If you want to look at the "GaudiTool" doc, either go to
    Gaudi under "See also:" or follow a link from any tool.
    
  More new features:
  ------------------
  - First full pre-release of the HLT
    . New version of HltGeneric
    . Use of TrgMuon that allows to skip TT for muons
    . First release of HltSelections
    . First release of HltSelChecker
    -> All this is for experts. Contact Patrick.Koppenburg@cern.ch
       if you need to run the HLT prototype.
    
  - On popular demand, the IParticleFilter now includes methods
    StatusCode filterByPID (const ParticleVector &, ParticleVector &, const std::string &, const bool alsoCC=true)=0
    StatusCode filterByPID (const ParticleVector &, ParticleVector &, const int &pid, const bool alsoCC=true)=0
    
      ParticleVector myKaons, myPiPlus, myPiMinus;
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myKaons,   "K+");
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiPlus,  "pi+", false);
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiMinus, "pi-", false);
    
    would return a vector of kaons (both sign) and pions.
    
  - New algorithm IsBEvent in DaVinciMCTools that easily allows to select 
    events containing a b quark in any sequencer. Actually works for
    any quark or particle(s)
  
  - New tool family "IPlotTool" with implementations SimplePlotTool and
    RecursivePlotTool. Make plots for a given Particle or ParticleVector.
    The plots have to be configured by options. The algorithm
    SimplePlots does nothing more than calling such tools:    
      HLTPlots.Members += { "SimplePlots/HLTB2HHPlots" };
      HLTB2HHPlots.PhysDesktop.InputLocations = { "Phys/HLTFilterB2HH" } ;
      HLTB2HHPlots.Plots.Variables = { "M", "Chi2", "Pt" } ;    
    plots the mass, chi2 and Pt of all particles in "Phys/HLTFilterB2HH"
    
  - Small changes in FlavourTagging. No need to run L1 anymore
  
  - The Tampering is released. Ask Mariusz Witek for help in you want to run it.
  
  - New preselections DsSelector and Bc2RhoPi
  
  - Few modification in LoKi

    . Relevant options
  - src/HltSelections_load.cpp
  - options/TrgTracks.opts
    . Modified accordingly

! 2005-01-12 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSharedD0.opts
  - options/HLTSharedKstar.opts
  - options/HLTSharedPhi.opts
    . Options for the shared basic resonances. 
      IMPORTANT: There is no D~0 in HLT. Every decay to h+h- with h=K,pi
      and a mass compatible with D0 is a D0. Never a D~0!
      Consequently D*- -> D0 pi- and D*+ -> D0 pi+!
      Same for B0->K*D0.
  - options/HLTselB2HH.opts
  - options/HLTselBd2D0Kstar.opts
  - options/HLTselBd2DstarPi.opts

  - options/HLTselBs2JpsiPhi.opts
  - options/HLTselBs2PhiGamma.opts
  - options/HLTselBs2PhiPhi.opts
  - options/HLTselDstar.opts
    . Refelect the new locations
  - options/HLTSelections.opts
    . Use the new options
  - src/MakeResonances.{cpp,h}
    . New option "DecayDescriptors", a vector of strings that *supercedes*
      the DecayDescriptor for the initialisation of the 
      DecodeSimpleDecayDescriptor tool. This allows the same algorithm to
      find several decays. 
      Example:
    HLTSharedD02HH.DecayDescriptors = { "D0 -> pi+ pi-", "D0 -> K+ pi-", "D0 -> pi+ K-", "D0 -> K+ K-" } ;

! 2005-01-11 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HltMuonHighway.opts
    . Upper mass in dimuons set to 14 TeV
    (tag as pk20050112)

! 2005-01-11 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSelections.opts
  - options/DVHLTExSelections.opts
    . Include HltGeneric.opts *after* Hlt.opts. This can also be done in
      DVHLTCorr.opts. Needs HltGeneric v2r1 and TrgSys v1r1p1
  
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTSelections.opts
    . Add a sequencer HLTExclusive
    . Add an empty sequencer TrueSignals. It can be filled in HltSelChecker
  - options/HltselB*.opts
    . Add them to HLTExclusive sequence
    
! 2005-01-10 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTselBd2DstarPi.opts
    . rename "HLTDstar2D0Pi" to "HLTDstarForBd2DstarPi"
  - options/HLTselBd2JpsiKs.opts
    . Removed. High-IP J/psis are in MuonHighway
  - src/MakeResonances.*
    . Use IPlotTools to make recursive plots.
      Example:
// D* stream
HLTselDstar.Members += {"MakeResonances/HLTFilterDstar"};
[...]
HLTFilterDstar.HistoProduce = true ;
HLTFilterDstar.DaughterPlots.Variables = { "M", "Chi2", "Pt", "IPs" } ;
HLTFilterDstar.MotherPlots.Variables =   { "M", "Chi2", "Pt", "IPs", "FS" } ;
HLTFilterDstar.DaughterPlotsPath = "DstarIn" ;
HLTFilterDstar.MotherPlotsPath   = "DstarOut";

! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg
  - options/HLTselB2HH.opts
  - options/HLTselB2MuMu.opts
    . Typo fix.
    
! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg for Guy Wilkinson
  - options/TrgTracks.opts
    . The copying of pi, K, mu, gamma should not be in the main HLT sequence 
      or hadronic channels would need a muon to be there to be found.
    
! 2005-01-06 - P. Koppenburg
  # Complete rewriting of the options using the new MakeResonances and 
  # FilterDesktop algorithms. Wherever it is possible a single algorithm
  # is used instead of two or even three, in order to avoid unnecessary 
  # access to the TES.

  - src/MakeResonances.{h,cpp}
    . Replacement algorithm for CombineParticles. Will obviosuly not stay 
      in this package forever.
    . Uses the ByPIDFilterCriterion to have the same syntax as 
      FilterDesktop (replacing RefineSelection), in Phys/DaVinciFilter
    . Allows to apply a mass window *before* the vertex cut that can 
      save orders of magnitude in CPU time for a three-body decay 
      for instance.
    . Allows to kill overlapping combination of particles (can be switched off
      by options)  
    . Practical Example:
         MakeResonances.PhysDesktop.InputLocations = {"Phys/PreLoadKaons", "Phys/PreLoadPions", "Phys/PreLoadProtons"};

         MakeResonances.DecayDescriptor = "[D_s- -> K+ K- pi-]cc";
         //MakeResonances.DaughterFilter.Selections = {"K- : BooleanFilterCriterion",
         //                                           "pi+ : BooleanFilterCriterion"};
         MakeResonances.MotherFilter.Selections = {"D_s- : VtxFilterCriterion/DsFilter"};
         MakeResonances.Window = 50*MeV ;
         MakeResonances.KillOverlap = true ;
         MakeResonances.MotherFilter.DsFilter.MaxChi2 = 200 ; // some filtering

      MCParticle associated. For each specific hadronic channel:
       - Prints the MCTree of B-meson in the event
       - Filter the tracks that have an associated MCParticle belonging to the 
         decay of interest

    . Complete revision. Correct bug in masses of mothers.
  - src/ChangePID.cpp
    . For composite particles, use the vertex of the first origin and not
      the one of the oldest ancestor, to avoid loosing the PID of the
      new daughters 
      (affects only the chain CombinedParticles -> ChangeDecayChain -> ChangePID )
    
! 2004-09-07 - P. Koppenburg
  - src/ChangeDecayChain.cpp
    . Accept four more options
      - SeparateOutputs = true ;
        allows to put the mother in ChangeDecayChainMother and 
        the daughters in ChangeDecayChainDaughter.
      - MotherLocation = "blabla" ;
      - DaughterLocation = "blablabla" ;
        Changes these locations to "blabla"
      - MoreReplacements: Allows to provide two replacements for the same decay 
        chain. For instance
        ChangeDecayChain.Particles = {"rho(770)0", "pi+", "pi-"};
        ChangeDecayChain.Replacements = {"K*(892)0", "K+", "pi-"};

         ChangeDecayChain.PhysDesktop.InputLocations = {"Phys/MyRhos"};
         ChangeDecayChain.Decay = "rho(770)0 -> ^pi+ ^pi-";
         ChangeDecayChain.Particles = {"rho(770)0", "pi+", "pi-"};

! 2004-07-09 - P. Koppenburg
   - src/ChangePID.*
     . DVAlgorithm that copies a particle into
       another location and changes its PID. Works for single (from protoparticle)
       and composite particles (from vertex). In the former case 
       the energy is recalculated. Never apply this algorithm on particles
       created by a mass-constrained vertex fitter (obviously).

! 2004-12-16 - P. Koppenburg
 - DaVinciTools/IParticleFilter.h
   . Added filterByPID methods
     These two methods allow to get a subset of particles
     with the same PID without having to use the PIDFilterCriterion
     -> The same instance of ParticleFilter can be used for all
      Particles.
      ParticleVector myKaons, myPiPlus, myPiMinus;
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myKaons,   "K+");
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiPlus,  "pi+", false);
      sc = particleFilter()->filterByPID(parts, myPiMinus, "pi-", false);
      would return a vector of kaons (both sign) and pions.

Currently 3 functions are implemented:

  1) decayAngle    (which is a generalisation of 
                    LoKi::Particles::RestFrameAngle functor.
                   It allows to avalyate not only "decay" angle, but also
                   "helicity" angle (suitable for  
                     "0 -> ( 1 ->  0 + 0 ) + 0"  or 
                     "0 -> ( 1 -> 0 + 0 ) + gamma" decays )

  2) transversityAngle 
                    Evaluation of "transversity" angle, 
                    which is very useful to disantangle the states 
                    with different CP-parity for 
                     "0 -> ( 1 -> 1/2 + 1/2 ) + ( 1 -> 0 + 0 )"  decays 

  3) forwardBackwardAngle
                    Evaluation of angle, useful for estimatuon of 
                    forward backward asymmetry for 
                     "0 -> X + (1/2+1/2)" decays  


  For the first period, the file LoKi/Angles.h 
  is not included into the overall LoKi/LoKi.h, 
  therefore explicit '#include "LoKi/Angles.h"' is required.
      - to be fixed later
                     

  - LoKi/Extract.h
    new function to "Extract" the connet of the particle(s):
   
    getTrgTracks, trgTracks 
       these functions allow to extract all "TrgTracks" from the given Particle 
       of set of Particles 

    getOrigins, origins
       These functions allow to extarct all "origin" (==ContainedObject) form 
       the given particle or set of Particles.

       These function will be used to substiture the "overlap check" in the LoKi's loops
       (currently overlapping test is based on ProtoParticle content, 
        and therefore not applicable for Hlt particles. For next version
        it will be based on "origin" content and therefore 
        it wiull be applicable for Hlt particles as well)
        
  - cmt/requirements   version increment to v3r7 


!========================== Stripping v1r6 2005-01-18 ===================
! 2004-12-14 - P. Koppenburg
  - python/strip.py

  - src/SelResultCorrelations.cpp
    . Make the table width depend on the length of the algorithms name that
      are actually in. This requires some trick:

   . Make it a GaudiAlgorithm, use err()...  and tool<>()...

! 2004-11-15 - Peter Igo-Kemenes
 - src/EffSelCheck.cpp
   . An error has been corrected: There was an unnecessary "break" statement 
     in a for-loop preventing one from considering ALL decays of interest 
     which were found in the selection. The break statement has been taken out.
   . The code has been modified: the selection efficiency is now correctly
     normalised in such cases where the decay of interest consists of idendical
     sub-heads (e.g. Bs->PhiPhi).
   . The range of the mass-histograms for sub-heads is now calculated
     automatically using the width information in the ParticleProperties. 
     The minimum range of the mass histograms is +- 100 MeV about the nominal 
     mass value; but in the case of broad resonances (e.g. a1) this is increased 
     to +- twice the "width" with width = ParticleProperty->maxWidth().

    fix a bug/feature/typo   (Thanks to slc3 platform)

    bug fix for TrgTrack -> MC matching 


! 2004-11-24 - Vanya BELYAEV

 - LoKi/Tuple.h, src/Tuple.cpp

    From now TrgDecision object could be put directly into NTuple with 1 line of code:
    
    const TrgDecision* trg = get<TrgDecision>( TrgDecisionLocation::Default );
    Tuple tuple = nTuple("My Analysis N-Tuple");
    tuple << TupleColumn("", trg ) ;
    tuple->write() ;

    Now this trick is available for
       EventHeader, L0DuReport, L1Score and TrgDecision  classes.
    e.g.

     const EventHeader* hdr = ... ; 
     const L0DUReport*  l0  = ... ; 
     const L1Score*     l1  = ... ; 
     const TrgDecison*  trg = ... ; 
  
     tuple << TupleColumn( "" , hdr ) 
           << TupleColumn( "" , l0  )
           << TupleColumn( "" , l1  )
           << TupleColumn( "" , trg ) ;

     tuple->write() ;

     It worth to emphasize here that "TupleColumn" is applicable 
     for *ALL* types of column, and in the case of 
      "no template specialization defined" the expresion
  
          tuple << TupleColumn( "name" , object ) ;

     is equivalent to the expression
   
          tuple->column( "name" , object ) ;

 - few new features to modify the technical implementation of MC truth associations

     1) now LoKi is able to use MC truth accosiation for 
		     "basic" Particles, created from TrgTrack
     2) The "input" information is in a form of object 
        which implements the interface: IRelation<TrgTrack,MCParticle> 

     3) From now LoKi algorithm is able to read relation tables 
        directly from TES
        The list of tables used from MC relations is under the control 
        of new proeprties of classs LoKi::Algo
       
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Property     | Default |  Description 
   --------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------

                 |         |  which implement the interface
                 |         |     IRelation<Particle,MCParticle> 
                 |         |  e.g the relation tables for 
                 |         |  composite particle associator or "chi2" associator

                 |         | e.g. the relation table for

                 |         | e.g. the relation tables for charged and neutral 
                 |         | protoparticle associators

                 |         |    IRelation<TrgTrack,MCParticle>
                 |         | e.g. the tabel produced by new algorithm
                 |         | TrgLinks2TrgTables algorithm from Tools/LoKiHlt package 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NB:
      The tables used here need to be properly declared to 'Data-On-Demand' 
      service, or alternatitevy some "fine tutning" with job-options is required.
 

      For some time these properties with coexist with "associators" properties, 
      later the associators properties will be removed 
 
      For current default configuration, all "new" featured are disabled. 
      For the next step ( based on LHCB_v17r1 ) the interchange of 
      "direct tables" and "associators" will be performed.
      And later, the associators will be removed from LoKi.

 - LoKi/NamedRange.h
   new concept of templated "named" range is introduced.
   New class LoKi::NamedRange_<TYPE> extends the standard 
   LoKi::Range_<TYPE> with string field "name".
 - LoKi/Selected.h 
   Substitute  Range_  -> NamedRange_ 

   From now all LoKi's ranegs are "Named" range.

   Through the goodies of templates and typedef *NO* user code 
   needs to be changed, (But everything *MUST* be recompiled)

   This new concept allows more control over loops ets..

    Range pions = select( "pi" , .... ) ;
   
    info() << " Range  name=" << pions.name() 
           <<        " size=" << pions.size() << endreq ;
  
  It is especially useful for "explicit loops" 
 
      Range pions = select( "pi" , ... ) ;
      Range kaons = select( "K"  , ... ) ;
    
     Loop D0 = loop( pions + kaons , "D0" );

   the TrgTrack. 0 = no vertex assigned...
!========================== TrgTools v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-11-12 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix the TrgParticleMaker: 
    - Option 'MakeNEutrals', default false
    - Produces electrons if any particle is tagges as such
    - the conversion was not done properly, only long tracks
      were made as particle in all cases...
    - Default is NOT to convert non-prolongated VeloTT.
 - Sort VeloCoord during the decoding (L1R, L1Phi, Raw) to insure
   that data are properly sorted. In principle done by the TELL1
   board and then by th efilling of the buffer, but just in case...

! 2004-11-05 - C Carloganu

   . Printout PV location on debug() mode
 
! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - TrgInitEvent doesn't clear the containers. This is taken care of by the 
   algorithms.
 - TrgVertices are converted in TrgParticleMaker, this was in TrgTrackToContainer

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - In TrgMCReconstructed, the container checked is now a jobOption.
 - L1InitEvent doesn't register L1Event in TES. L1Score is also not needed
   by the L1Processing sequence, just for monitoring.
 - TrgParticleMaker creates a TES container from the Long tracks, and the non
   prolongated Velo-TT. The name of these two containers are job options. 
   The second name can be empty. The key of the tracks from the second container
   are shifted by 10000.
!========================== TrgVelo v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Use the RSector and backward track method, instead of playing with type.

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - Detect if in L1 or HLT, to change the container names
 - Compute the average Velo charge in HLT context (VeloSpaceTracking)
   and store it in pidQuality.
 - In the space track fit, use a multiple scattering term constant with
   P, assumming all tracks have the same Pt.
!========================== TrgVeloTT v6r0 2004-11-12 ===================
! 2004-11-12 - Olivier Callot
 - New option 'NotUsed' (true) to ask that hits used (when only 3) are not
   used. This was the default. If false, we still ask at least one of the
   two half-TT station to be unused. Increases efficiency (.5%) and 
   ghosts (2%), no turned on by default.
 - New option finalMatchTolSlope, default 0, studies in progress.

! 2004-11-09 - Olivier Callot
 - Split TrgVeloTT in 3 algorithms, and an imporved tool
    DecodeTTFromRaw
    DecodeTTFromL1
    TrgTTHitHolder
   The first two are the decoding from Raw or L1 Buffer, and the TrgTTHitHolder
   has now the structure by TTPlane of the hits. This makes TrgVeloTT lighter
   and will allow to have different versions in an easier way.

! 2004-11-09 J.A. Hernando
  - TrgVeloTT: Posibility of selecting the input and output container 
	of tracks (when no the algorihtms is not named "L1")
    option: InputTracksName and OutputTracksName

! 2004-10-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Do not track backward tracks.

! 2004-10-22 - Olivier Callot
 - Introduce the protection and fix for the faulty TT coding in L1Buffer as
   reported by Matt in a mail today: Protect if data = -1, exchange 2<->1 for 
   cluster size and increase strip number if size is now 1.
 - Detect L1/HLT context from name, can be changed by option 'Level1'.
   Remove option InputFromRawBuffer.

! 2004-10-18 - Olivier Callot
 - Adapt to the new names of the containers, differing for L1 and HLT

 - src/CaloTrackAlg.h, src/CaloTrackAlg.cpp
    the algorithm is modified to take advantage from 
    new class TrTrackUse from Calo/CaloUtils package 
 - src/CaloMergedPi0Alg.h, src/CaloMergedPi0Alg.cpp

    new property "EtCut" is added to skip the processing of 
    clusters with small transverse energy.
    The default value of this oproperty is -100*GeV
   (which implies "NO CUT", and "BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY" 
    in the sense of absolute reproducibility of results). 
    The idea comes from Olivier Deschamps and Cristina Carloganu.

    Another new property "MaxIterations" is added to reduce the 
    number of iterations 
    The default value (16) is "BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE"
    The idea comes from Olivier Deschamps and Cristina Carloganu.

    In addition few "tiny" modification are applied:
      - remove "count" loop 
      - location of spddigits and prs digits are moved from internal loop
        to a top level 

    The usage of EtCut=1.5*GeV and MaxIteration=6 togather with 
    these 'technical' optimizations  
    speeds up the execution of the algorithm approxmately 20 times.

 - introduce FAST "photon" matching of trigger track (TrgTrach) with 
   Calotrimeter clusters. For a moment follow "off-line" phylosophy:
   perfroam all-to-all mathcing and save result as a relation table 
   in TES. The supporting algorithm CaloCluster2TrgTrackAlg does this job.
   The execution is 5-6 times faster than the execution of 
   "standard" photon matching. The efficiency need to be testes 
   and studied.
   In real environment one coudl gain addiitonal factor of 2
   (since if one uses this "o nly" fo select neutral clusters - "photons")
   one does not need all-to-all matching (and one does not need to 
   register the table in TES!),  one just che the existence of 
   tracks with chi2<cut, which should be "fast" procedure.

   1) modify the internal match structure MatchStruct1 
      to invert the matrix in the constructor 
   2) modify the internal chi2 method to be more efficient 
      (eliminate the intermediate matrices) 
   3) introduce local matrix storage
   4) itoriducet mtrxOp methods for fast evaluation of matrix products

      new helper class to simplify the selection/rejection of 
      TrStoredTrack fro e.g. mathcing, monitoring, PID, etc...
      It defins a "standard" set of properties for "Component"
      classes ("Algorithm", "Service", "AlgTool") and few methods 
      for seelction.rejection of tracks, inspection, etc... 

      The clients : CaloReco, CaloMoniDst. CaloPIDs

! 2004-10-26 - P. Koppenburg 
  - options/DVTriggerFilter.opts
  - options/DaVinciElectrons.opts
  - options/DaVinciNeutrals.opts
    . Replace all Sequencers by GaudiSequencers
! 2004-10-26 - P. Koppenburg for Vanya Belyaev
  - options/DaVinciElectrons.opts
    . One need to substitute "CaloDeleteObjectsAlg" -> "TESFilter"   
      (the algorithm from LHCbAlgs package therefore one need to load DLL "LHCbAlgs" )
      and to ajust the property name for this algorithm:
       "ElectronDelete.Addresses" -> "ElectronDelete.DroppedContainers"

   . Let DVAlgorithm inherit from GaudiTupleAlg (which inherits from 
     GaudiHistoAlg). This change (as well as the one below) is fully
     backward compatible with the old inheritence from GaudiAlgorithm,
     but allows more features. It just requires to recompile all DaVinci.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v12r1>2004-09-16 DaVinci v12r1 - version with updated L1 and more HLT</A></H1><PRE>

 Identical to DaVinci v11r13 except:
      
 - Built on Gaudi v15r2 and LHCb v16r2
 
 - CaloDigitsFromRaw is now an "algorithm-on-demand"
 
 - New Trg Event model and updated L1 trigger
 
 - All DaVinci tools now run on particles made from trigger tracks for HLT.
   User selections can be adapted easily too:
   1) if you use the PV from VertexLocation::Primary, foresee the 
      possibility to get it from TrgVertexLocation::Velo3D in HLT mode
   2) Check always that the protoparticle is actually there
        PP = dynamic_cast<ProtoParticle*>((*iPart)->origin());
      might be NULL. In this case you can do
        TT = dynamic_cast<TrgTrack*>((*iPart)->origin());
      You will need to #include "Event/TrgTrack.h" for this.
   3) Replace DaVinciReco.opts by Hlt.opts and do not run any particle maker.
      You can decide if you want to make all particles both as pions and
      kaons (default), or only as kaons with
        TrgParticleMaker.MakeKaon = false ;
      Your particles will be in /Event/Phys/Trg
 
   This version uses the new CMT environment. The $CMTPATH points now to
   $HOME/cmtuser. Do not use $HOME/newmycmt anymore.

Vanya writes:
    I've put few modifications into Event/CaloEvent package 
    to provide the appropriate "loading-on-demand"  for 
    Calorimeter digits

    From now there is no nesessity to execute "CaloDigitsFromRaw" 
    algorithm at all.
    Algorithm itself is modified to produce only 1 
    containerner per instance (thus one need to have 4 
    instances for 4 calorimeters). The overall speed of 4 
    instances is improved by 20% by replacement of "sort" 
    with "stable_sort" algorithm and  with the proper 
    "reserve" manipulations.

    The corresponding instance will be invoked 
    automatically by nice Markus' service  "DataOnDemand".
