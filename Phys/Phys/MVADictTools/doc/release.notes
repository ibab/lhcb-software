!========================= MVADictTools v1r5 2014-07-25 =========================

!========================= MVADictTools v1r4 2014-02-20 =========================

! 2014-02-12 - Andrey Ustyuzhanin
 - Add support for Matrixnet models and example of usage
       (options/mvaDfromB_matrixnet.py)

!========================= MVADictTools v1r3 2014-02-12 =========================

! 2014-01-21 - Chris Jones
 - Add a workaround to the requirements file to fix missing GSL symbols
   during linking.
 - Add explicit usage for LoKiArrayFunctors and DaVinciInterfaces.
   Needed to make sure compilation is done in the correct order when all
   packages are in the same project (such as for branch releases).

! 2014-01-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified unit test to work from an arbitrary directory.

!========================= MVADictTools v1r2p1 2013-12-18 =========================

! 2013-11-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed use of std namespace in TMVATransform.cpp.

!========================= MVADictTools v1r2 2013-10-29 =========================

! 2013-11-14 - Sam Hall
 - Updated mvaDfromB.py with improved syntax and use of LoKi preambulo and also
   interfacing with the MVADictHelper module, such that only a single line is
   required.

! 2013-11-12 - Sam Hall
 - Added mvaDfromB.py and bdt_d2kpipi.xml.  The former (uses the latter) to run
   the D+ -> K- pi+ pi+ BDT on the B+ -> (D+ -> K- pi+ pi+) (rho -> pi+ pi-)
   decay at DaVinci level.  Hopefullly it is a comprehensiver example for both
   the use and the example LoKi functors, which are non-trivial.  The python
   file also has some PFNs (located at CERN) that to run over.

! 2013-10-24 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Added python directory with helper functions to configure MVA tool chains.
   Added an example options script to illustrate the use of these.
   The compact configuration depends on the stacked LoKi::HybridEngineActor
   to avoid the double lock problem.

!========================= MVADictTools v1r1 2013-10-02 =========================
! 2012-09-29 - Sam Hall
 - Looks for .xml in local directory and then in a path, specifically
   TMVATRANSFORMPATH - if file is still not found an error is thrown.

! 2013-08-08 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Added MVAManager algorithm.
   Holds one IParticleDictTool in order to avoid the
   double lock problem during instantiation of LoKi functors
   This class is only needed as a container for the tool.
   It has no functionality of its own
 - Added example how to cut on MVA output by using the VALUE functor
   and and the LoKi::Hybrid::DictValue tool.

! 2013-08-06 - Sebastian Neubert
 - small fix: replaced endmsg by std::endl

! 2013-08-05 - Chris Jones
 - Split code into a linker library and a component library, to allow
   sharing between the Gaudi components and the test applications.
 - Various other minor clean ups to the requirements and CMake files.

! 2013-08-02 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the unit test in the CMake configuration.

! 2013-08-02 - Sebastian Neubert
 - changed DictTransform policies to use std::ostream
 - Created header file for TMVAClassifierTool
 - added unit test framework for TMVATransform
 - added a first unit test
 - added qmtest call to utest

!========================= MVADictTools v1r0 2013-08-01 =========================

! 2013-08-01 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration.

! 2013-08-01 Sebastian Neubert
 - renamed the dictionary tools in the LoKi::Hybrid:: namespace
   MultiToolDictTool -> DictOfFunctors
   Dict2TupleTool    -> Dict2Tuple
   DictTransformTool -> DictTransform

! 2013-07-31 - Sam Hall
 - KeepVars added to TMVAClassifierTool

! 2013-07-30 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Creating LHCb package Phys/MVADictTools

! 2013-07-30 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Cleaning up
   Renamed several components
   Moved Dict tools into LoKiArrayFunctors
   Removed old stuff
   Added better comments to opt/mvaexampleTMVA.py
	 Added example options file opt/dictexample.py

! 2013-07-29 - Sam Hall
 - TMVATransform works, complete with output

! 2013-07-28 - Sam Hall
 - Added TestPhi2KK.xml (mini test bdt)
 - Options.h is now much better and TMVATransform is in a working state
   except for the branch -> fucntor matching.

! 2013-07-26 - Sebastian Neubert
 - New options with the correct usage of the branch and variable naming

! 2013-07-25 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Added DictMergeTool

! 2013-07-23 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Added example how to apply dicttools to a branch with several LoKi functors
   need to figure out how to solve the nameing issue for subbranches

! 2013-07-21 - Sam Hall
 - Added TMVATransform and rudimentary Options parser
 - Options parser then simplified and TMVAClassifier works!
   Well, the reader is initialized etc.

! 2013-07-22 - Sebastian Neubert
  - Added templated Dict2DictTool.
	  offers a more generic way to implement an MVAClassifier
    added info stream the Dict-Transform

! 2013-07-19 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Introducing new, more linear architecture
 - Adding MVAClassifierBase and inheriting MVAClassifierDummy from this one

! 2013-07-19 - Sam Hall
 - Removal of ChangeVariableNames map in favour of using branches

! 2013-07-19 - Sam Hall
 - Protections for TMVA in place, for example non-existent xml files and
   mismatch between xml variables and those given to the tool
 - Errors are thrown for any of the above, though not fatal, as the output can
   be useful (eg variable names in the xml file).
 - For any FAILURES the tuple is filled with 0.0 (perhaps this should be -1e10).
 - ChangeVariableNames added (via declareProperty) in order to map names in the
   given xml file to variable names in the ntuple.  This is done using an
   additional map.
 - Hopefully works(!), need a test BDT.

! 2013-07-18 - Sebastian Neubert, Sam Hall
 - Added MVAClassifierTMVA; added some protections for missing
   components. This calss is still WorkInProgress

! 2013-07-17 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Added Dict2TupleTool and fixed some initialisation issues

! 2013-07-11 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Adding working options file.
   So far everything is still dummy implementation
 	 but tool structure is building and can be configured

! 2013-07-10 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Adding complete set of Interfaces
 - The package depends on the new MultiToolDictTool which
   implements IParticleDictTool
 - Workflow is designed as follows:
 	 Configure a DictTool to access the functors needed by the MVA
   Configure an MVAClassifier (IDict2Val)
	 					 to use a specific MVAbackend
						 load WeightFile into backend etc
	 Configure a TupleToolMVAClassifier handing over
        - the DictTool
        - the MVAClassifier
   In the event loop:
 	 TupleToolMVAClassifier is applied to a particle
	    Calls DictTool
						Calls LoKi-Functors
						Fills Dictionary
						returns Dictionary
      Calls MVAClassifier through IDict2Val(Dict,)
			      Calls MVABackend
									return MVAresponse
						return MVAresponse
			Write MVAresponse into Tuple-Collumn
  end
