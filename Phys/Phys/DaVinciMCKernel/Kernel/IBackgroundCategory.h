/** @class IBackgroundCategory IBackgroundCategory.h Kernel/IBackgroundCategory.h
 *
 *  Returns the background category for a reconstructed candidate Particle. Many thanks
 *  go to all the users who tested this tool, but especially to Luis Fernandez,
 *  Patrick Koppenburg and Jeremie Borel for their assistance in the design and extensive
 *  help in ironing out bugs.
 *
 *Conditions:
 *
 *  -  <b>A:</b> all final-state particles used to form the candidate are matched to
 *        decay products of the same true MC particle (not necessarily the signal)
 *
 *  -  <b>B:</b> all final-state MC particles originating from the true MC particle
 *   defined in A are matched to particles used to form the candidate
 *   (except photons generated by PHOTOS);
 *   in case the decay descriptor of the true MC particle
 *   defined in A corresponds to an inclusive decay, "all final-state MC
 *   particles" only include the particles required in this (semi-)inclusivei
 *   decay.
 *
 *  -  <b>C:</b> all final-state particles used to form the candidate are correctly
 *  identified, i.e. have been assigned their correct (true) mass
 *
 *  -  <b>D:</b> the true MC particle defined in A is a signal decay according
 *   to the decay descriptor, or the head of a decay chain which differs
 *  from the signal decay chain only by the presence or absence of
 *  intermediate resonances but has other otherwise the same head,
 * same final state particles and same topology.
 *
 *  -  <b>E:</b> the true MC particle defined in A is a signal decay according
 *  to the decay descriptor, and all intermediate states of this
 * decay are correctly reconstructed (as listed in the decay descriptor)
 *
 *  -  <b>F:</b> the true MC particle defined in A has a mass which does not exceed
 *  the mass of the head of the decay descriptor by more than 100 MeV/c2
 *  (tunable parameter)
 *
 *  -  <b>G:</b> at least one final-state particle used to form the candidate is a ghost
 *
 *  -  <b>H:</b> final-state particles used to form the candidate are matched to
 *  true particles from at least two different collisions (pileup)
 *
 *  -  <b>I:</b> at least one final-state particles used to form the candidate is
 *  matched to a true decay product of a b-hadron
 *  (following mother-daughter relationships all the way through)
 *
 *  -  <b>J:</b> at least one final-state particles used to form the candidate is
 *  matched to a true decay product of a c-hadron
 *  (following mother-daughter relationships all the way through)
 *
 *  - <b>K:</b> at least two final state daughters are matched to the same MCParticle.
 *
 *  - <b>L:</b> at least one final state daughter is matched to an MCParticle which is the
 *  MCMother of an MCParticle matched to another final state daughter.
 *
 *  - <b>M:</b> at least one final state daugher is associated to an MCParticle from the primary vertex
 *
 *  - <b>N:</b> every final state daughter is associated to an MCParticle from the same primary vertex
 *

 *<b>Examples:</b>
 *
 *a) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi decay could be categorized
 *  as signal with respect to the decay descriptor
 *  {[[B_s0]nos -> (D_s- => K+ K- pi-) pi+]cc,
 *   [[B_s0]os  -> (D_s+ => K- K+ pi+) pi-]cc}
 *  even if the MC truth indicates a Bs -> (Ds -> (phi -> KK) pi) pi decay.
 *
 *b) A reconstructed Bd -> K* mumu should not be categorized as a signal
 *  with respect to the decay descriptor
 *  {[[B0]nos -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu- {,gamma} {,gamma})
 *               (K*(892)0 -> K+ pi-)]cc,
 *   [[B0]os  -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu- {,gamma} {,gamma})
 *               (K*(892)~0 -> K- pi+)]cc}
 *  no matter what the MC truth indicates.
 *
 *c) A reconstructed Bd -> K* mumu should not be categorized as a signal
 *  with respect to the decay descriptor
 *  {[[B0]nos -> mu+ mu- (K*(892)0 -> K+ pi-)]cc,
 *   [[B0]os -> mu- mu+ (K*(892)~0 -> K- pi+)]cc}
 *  if the MC truth indicates a Bd -> K* J/psi(mumu) decay.
 *
 *d) A reconstructed Bs -> mu+mu- candidate matched to a true
 *  J/psi -> mu+mu- decay (could happen if the sidebands around the Bs
 *  are very large) and a reconstructed Bd -> K+K- matched to a true
 *  Bs -> K+K- are both classified as fully-reconstructed physics
 *  background.
 *
 *e) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi candidate matched to a
 *  a true Bd -> (D- -> Kpipi) pi decay (mis-ID of one of the pions
 *  from the D- as a kaon) is classified as a reflection.
 *
 *f) A reconstructed B- -> (D0 -> K-pi+) pi- candidate matched to
 *  to the K-,pi+ and pi- of a true Lambda_b -> (Lambda_c -> p K-pi+) pi-
 *  is classified as a partially-reconstructed physics background.
 *
 *g) A reconstructed Bs -> (Ds -> KKpi) pi+ candidate with all 4 tracks
 *  matched to the true final state particles of a true
 *  Bs -> (Bs ->KKpi) pi+pi0 decay is classified as a low-mass background.
 *
 * Please note that there are now three additional categories:
 *
 * FromPV : The candidate particle has at least one final state daughter which
 *          comes directly from the primary vertex or a short lived resonance,
 *          and the event is not a pileup.
 *
 * AllFromSamePV : The candidate particle's final state daughters all come from
 *                 the same PV, or from short lived resonances from the same PV.
 *
 * Clone : two final-state Particles are associated to the same MC Particle.
 *
 * Hierarchy : a final state particle has an associated MCParticle which is also
 *             the original mother of the MCParticle associated to one of the other
 *             final state particles.
