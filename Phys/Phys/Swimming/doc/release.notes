!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= Swimming v3r8 2015-10-05 ==========================

! 2015-08-12 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove #include of obsolete Gaudi headers

!========================= Swimming v3r7 2015-04-22 =========================

! 2015-03-23 - V. Gligorov
 - change obsolete PropertimeFitter for LoKi::LifetimeFitter

!========================= Swimming v3r6 2015-02-24 =========================

! 2015-01-19 - Eduardo Rodrigues
 - Added python/Swimming/__init__.py to please CMake.

!========================= Swimming v3r5 2014-12-15 =========================

! 2014-11-06 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed CMake configuration (SwimmingComponent should be a module and not a
   library).

!========================= Swimming v3r4 2014-10-30 =========================

! 2014-10-07 - Olli Lupton
 - Fixes to work with changes in Event/SwimmingEvent to support ROOT6 (use of
   Swimming::Helpers).

!========================= Swimming v3r3 2014-09-30 =========================

! 2014-09-30 - Olli Lupton
 - Add StrippingConfigSubstitutions option to allow manipulation of the stripping options
   via the Configurable. This is useful for swimming MC if PID cuts are turned off.
 - Other fixes for MicroDST writing when swimming MC.
 - Cope with DaVinci not having a persistency attribute.

! 2014-09-24 - Olli Lupton
 - Add MicroDSTElements option so these can be overriden by options. More flexibility
   to cope with the eventual (M)DST layout for a data taking period not being set when
   the Moore releases for that data are made. (e.g. DAQ/RawEvent -> Trigger/RawEvent).
 - Make the default MDST elements more in line with the recent stripping elements.  

! 2014-09-23 - Olli Lupton
 - Add extra option which makes the current swimming stage evaluate the
   decision and candidate information at the RAW values saved by previous
   stages. This is needed for DecayTreeFitter, and may be useful for debugging.
 - Fix logic error in matching stripping candidates.
 - Allow multiple search locations for stripping candidates, i.e. StripCands is now
   { offline candidate location : [ stripping locations ] }
 - Add configurable option to control whether or not composite particles made
   from the same tracks are considered identical or not. Just in case the correct
   logic for prompt KsHH isn't correct elsewhere.
 - Make sure the matching behaviour is consistent when matching offline candidates
   to stripping candidates.
 - Add configurable option for DecayTreeFitter mass constraints, and allow for
   storing >1 set of TAU values at the turning points.
 - The DecayTreeFitter lifetime fitter option now seems to work for KsHH.

! 2014-09-20 - Marco Clemencic
 - Updated CMake configuration after latest changes.

! 2014-09-18 - Olli Lupton
 - Merge in changes from v2r4b branch, commit messages from that branch below.
 - Many small fixes to blend Roel's work of 2 years ago into the current head.
 - This now supports multiple offline candidates etc, and should be OK with e.g.
   swimming KsPiPi and KsKK in the same job without getting them mixed up with
   one another.
 - This should behave sensibly when given both D0 and D0bar versions of the same
   event, building a list of distinct track combinations rather than just reading
   in the containers from the DST.
 - Reset the PV positions after the swimming loop. There are 2 PV containers on
   Stripping20 DSTs but one of these is missing PVs which were not used by any
   stripping candidates. The other contains all PVs, but they have their positions
   offset after the stripping swimming using old versions of the swimming code.
 - Add CMT dependency on Event/SwimmingEvent.
 - Populate the extra information field of LHCb::TurningPoint objects we produce,
   saving the lifetime fit, chi2 etc. at the turning points.
 - Change StrippingLine string property to StrippingLines list property in the
   Configurable so we can enable multiple stripping lines.
 - Change OffCands to be a dict mapping { offline candidate location : p2tpprefix }.
 - Change StripCands to be a dict mapping { offline candidate location : stripping
   candidate location }.
 - Adjust full DST output options for swimming the stripping to use the MuDSTCands
   property. Otherwise you get the 'D0' written out but not the 'D*'.
 - Set TOSFracTT = 0 for Trigger TISTOSing. 
 - Add SkipEventIfNoMuDSTCandsAnywhere option to modify the behaviour of 
   SkipEventIfNoMuDSTCandFound (do we require *all* locations contain candidates
   or only some of them).
 - Add OverrideStageName option so we can override what name the TPs are stored under
   in the SwimmingReport. e.g. Trigger_Exclusive if we're swimming both the inclusive
   and exclusive triggers for KsHH in the same production.
 - Add two new HLT transforms for swimming the inclusive D* trigger (2012). We need
   two different ones because an IPCHI2 cut value changed partway through the year.
 - Use new functions defined in Event/SwimmingEvent for hashing and matching particles,
   optionally including the PIDs of composite particles (i.e. optionally considering a
   D0 and D0bar to be the same if they are built from the same tracks).
 - Note currently the P2TPRelations are destroyed by the step in the swimming workflow
   which prepares the DSTs on which the trigger swimming has been run for the stripping
   swimming stage. It is recommended to write the trigger P2TPRelations to a dummy
   location and remove them before running the stripping swimming.
 - As of this commit, the package is tested for swimming KsHH without refitted PVs or
   advanced lifetime fitters.
 - Include example configuration scripts for swimming KsHH exclusive/inclusive triggers
   and stripping to scripts/

! 2012-03-06 - Roel Aaij
 - Add functions to Swimming::Service to set and get signal tracks.

! 2012-02-08 - Roel Aaij
 - Add extra TisTos tool for debugging
 - Add OnlyEvents configuration option to run the swimming only on specified events.

! 2011-12-26 - Roel Aaij
   Support for:
 - Multiple offline candidates
 - Multiple offline candidate locations
 - Support for stripping lines which refit PVs
 - PV refitting for lifetime calculations
 - Use of DecayTreeFitter for lifetime calculations

!========================= Swimming v3r2 2014-05-19 =========================

! No commit release notes ;(

!========================= Swimming v3r1p2 2014-04-30 =========================

! 2014-04-30 - G. Raven
 - add DetCond to requirements file

! 2014-04-30 - G. Raven
 - add explicit dependency on Det/DetCond to make sure that in Moore v22r1
   Swimming is build _after_ DetCond

!========================= Swimming v3r1p1 2013-12-16 =======================
! 2013-12-16 - N. Torr
 - Patch for release with DaVinci v32r2 stack

!========================= Swimming v3r1 2013-11-11 =========================
! 2013-10-16 - V. Gligorov
 - Update Hlt transforms to include a transform for swimming the
   inclusive D* trigger used in 2012 datataking.
 - Update VELO acceptance calculator to ignore non-VELO tracks.

! 2013-10-14 - V. Gligorov
 - Update example scripts for swimming the trigger and stripping,
   as well as the DecayTreeTupleD2hh.py script, so that we have a 
   working example for the full analysis chain for testing the
   2012 charm production. 

! 2013-10-10 - Roel Aaij

 - Fix method resolution problems when swimming the stripping. There
   is a dictionary related problem, which I suspect has to do with a
   clash between Reflex and CINT dictionaries for std::map
   classes. This fix I coded up is super hacky and the fact that the
   solution works depends heavily on the details of when dictionaries
   are loaded. 

! 2013-09-30 - Roel Aaij
 - Add some documentation explaining the deterministic nature of RandomSelector.

! 2013-09-27 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix swimming the stripping. Apparently something was going wrong with the
   types setup in Swimming.decorators; it looks like (Py)ROOT sometimes messes
   with the class table. As a workaround, the definitions have been moved into
   the eventloop, but are only called once.
 - Explicitely load SwimmingEventDict to get access to Swimming::hashParticle

! 2013-09-26 - V. Gligorov
 - Fix bug in SwimmingTisTos.py introduced by an earlier rollback
 - Make Configuration.py properly use either the __dev__ or normal DSTWriters
   depending on the avilability of the former
 - Update GeneralSetup to make it clear this is obsolete
 - Update SwimTriggerB2JpsiX.py, SwimStrippingB2JpsiX.py to be relevant 
   to testing Moore v14rX versions 

!========================= Swimming v3r0p1 2013-06-13 =========================

! 2013-05-13 - V. Gligorov (Added by CRJ as Vava forgot...)
 . Bug fix to something probably very important, but I don't know as no entry 
   was made...

!========================= Swimming v3r0 2013-04-05 =========================

! 2012-12-05 - V. Gligorov
 - Add scripts for correcting the VELO acceptance bug to the scripts directory,
   together with scripts to execute it on Stripping17 KK/KPi/PiPi ntuples.  
 - Correct bug in VELO acceptance calculation. This now takes into account the
   possibility of tertiary vertices, e.g. in B->DPi, D->3h.
 - Rewrite code which calculates the number of VELO hits on a track to take
   into account more details of the VELO geometry, for example tracks
   crossing the VELO halves, or tracks starting outside the VELO and going back in. 

!========================= Swimming v2r8p1 2012-11-30 =========================

! 2012-11-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

!========================= Swimming v2r8 2012-10-04 =========================

! 2012-07-23 - Nick Torr

	 event packing on DSTs from stripping 18 onwards
 - Removed .__dev__. DST writers as they are now obosolete
 - Removed "copyProtoParticles = True" option as this is also obsolete

!========================= Swimming v2r7 2012-07-06 =========================

!========================= Swimming v2r5 2012-02-29 =========================

! 2012-02-17 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix tiny bug in event counting when running a set number of events; one too
   many was always processed.
 - Add a reference to the GlobalParams instance to the AppMgr to be able to
   call runSwimmingStep from top level GaudiPython.

! 2012-02-16 - Roel Aaij

! 2011-12-20 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix Swimming().OutputFile behaviour when swimming the stripping.
   The filename must be of the format prefix.somename.(m)dst. If prefix is 
   missing, it will be set to "Swimming"

!====================== Phys/Swimming v2r4p1 2011-12-07 =======================
! 2011-12-13 - V. Gligorov
 - Add fixes to Configuration.py for some trigger reconstruction steps which
   put their outputs in non-standard TES locations. Enable banks which need to
   be killed when rerunning the HLT to be passed as an argument, in case this
   fix does not catch all the misbehaving lines. 
 - Add more examples. 

! 2011-12-13 - Roel Aaij

   could be due to undeclared dependencies...
 - Add a magic macro_depend line to also try and help fix the dependencies

! 2011-11-26 - Chris Jones
 - Rename the libraries libSwimmingFunctions.so and libSwimmingFunctionsDict.so
   to avoid any possible naming conflicts with other libraries (libFunctions.so 
   is too generic a name).

 - Add multi-candidates swimming functionality (SelectMethod = "all") and
	 modified EventLoop and Configuration accordingly.
 - Remove explicit relations of daughter's tracks to TPs in EventLoop.

 - Small fix for odin check in RunSwimming.py

! 2011-10-20 - Roel Aaij
 - For a final refined turning point, the last interval is moved forward by half
   the final granularity to avoid a systematic downward bias (swimming is always
   left to right).
 - Use pprint to make debug more readable (but also more lines).
 - Add AppMgr.stop, finalize, exit at the end.

! 2011-10-19 - Roel Aaij
 - Fixed some HltDecLast fallout from a previous change.
 - And reverted the fix because an important aspect was overlooked.

! 2011-10-11 - Roel Aaij
 - Many changes, mainly:
   . Use new event model classes to persist swimming result.
   . Update the way trigger results are passed around.
   . Write the swimming result to the MicroDST.
   . Add candidate selection possibility, currently deterministic random or
     the first candidate.

!============================== v2r0 14-08-2011 ===============================
! 2011-08-14 - V. Gligorov
 - Update to 2011 data.
 - Includes the following changes :
   . Added code to get VELO geometric acceptance for each track at each
     turning point.
   . Added trigger tranformations for 2011 data.
   . Rewritten event loop which no longer needs to rewind events in order to swim
     them. Many thanks to Marco Clemencic and Gerhard Raven for hints and tips
     in this respect. The timing to swim a single event is now ~10s/event for HLT,
     ~4s/event for Stripping. 
 
!============================== v1r2 29-05-2011  ===============================

! 2011-05-29 - V. Gligorov

!============================== v1r1 16-04-2011 ==============================

! 2011-04-16 - Vladimir Gligorov
 - Update of the code. Setup options moved into separate files where possible.
   TisTos code moved into its own script, SwimmingTisTos.py.
 - Added functionality to store information on how many of the final state
   tracks from the signal candidate were reconstructed in HLT1/2, and how
   many of these tracks were TOS with respect to the signal trigger in HLT1. 

!============================== v1r0 13-04-2011 ==============================

! 2011-04-13 - Vladimir Gligorov
  - First commit of the code which used to live in Hlt2CommissioningScripts.
    This has been broken up into several smaller scripts. 
    . RunSwimming   : is the main script which controls the event loop
    . RefineTPs     : controls the recursive refinement of the turning points
    . HltTransforms : contains the transformations which allow swimming from TCKs 
    . SwimmingUtils : contains miscallaneous helper functions
    . Globals       : contains a helper class to pass "globals" (e.g. the TES)
                      between the various modules
