! Package     : Kernel/SelectionLine
! Responsible : Gerhard Raven
! Purpose     : Infrastructure for HLT and stripping 'lines'
! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


!======================= SelectionLine v1r6 2015-10-05 ========================

! 2015-08-30 - Gerhard Raven
 - replace endreq with endmsg

! 2015-08-12 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove #include of obsolete gaudi headers
 - replace ListItem with TypeNameString

!======================= SelectionLine v1r5 2015-03-03 ========================

! 2015-03-03 - Stefano Perazzini
 - Added HLT1 and HLT2 stages to Selection::Line::Stage class in order to deal
   with split Hlt 

!========================= SelectionLine v1r4 2015-01-15 =========================

! 2014-12-30 - Gerhard Raven
 - avoid clash between make_unique and std::make_unique when compiling as
   C++14 (somewhere someone is doing a 'using namespace std' ???) 

! 2014-12-29 - Gerhard Raven
 - C++11 & C++14 cleanup

! 2014-12-21 - Gerhard Raven
 - in retrieveSubAlgorithms, switch back to std::list (instead of std::deque)
   to insure that iteratora are not invalidated during insert... and switch
   from std::list to std::forward_list
 - unexpectedly (as least for me) the HltDecReports in the stripping change 'shape',
   i.e. the number of lines which are processed varies (occasionally) from event
   to event. Enhance the 'hinted' insertion to deal with this...

! 2014-12-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove Selection::Line::resetExecuted -- the event manager calls resetExecuted
   of all algorithms, so no need to call it from here as well..
    
!========================= SelectionLine v1r3 2014-12-15 =========================

! 2014-12-04 - Gerhard Raven
 - further reduce overhead; 
   note: Hlt::Line and SelectionAlg again need to be updated accordingly!
 - flag turbo by setting bit 0x80 of executionstage

! 2014-12-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - change signature of numberOfCandidates so that we can avoid filling 'all zeros'
   into TPRofile, which is not cheap. This change saves O(2%) of the CPU time in
   the HLT! Note that Hlt::Line and SelectionAlg need to be updated coherently.

! 2014-11-30 - Gerhard Raven
 - make Turbo a dedicated property, check for consistency with configured algorithms
 - use std::chrono instead of Gaudi time functions for timing measurments
 - remove unneeded check on TurboMIAB dummy algorithm

!========================= SelectionLine v1r2 2014-11-05 =========================

! 2014-11-04 - Sean Benson
 - Check for Turbo signature, if found set executionStage to 254.

! 2014-10-02 - Gerhard Raven
 - do NOT catch exceptions thrown by subalgorithms  
 - streamline creation of subalgorithms
 - C++11 cleanup

!========================= SelectionLine v1r1 2014-05-16 =========================

! 2014-04-15 - Gerhard Raven
 - Replace boost::array with std::array.
 - Put Stages in a std::unique_ptr instead of managing them explicitly.

! 2014-04-15 - Chris Jones
 - If a tool fails to initialize in Selection::Line::initialize(), pass this
   failure back to the application framework.
 - Delete the Stage objects in Selection::Line::~Line().

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p5 2013-07-08 =========================

! 2013-07-05 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Moved definition of static const double timeHistoLowBound from class declaration
   to unnamed namespace in order to fix compiler errors under gcc4.7/4.8

! 2013-07-05 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Switch units of elapsed time back to microSec (had been set to nanoSec)
   (caused every event to be marked as too slow, due to the factor of 1000)

! 2013-07-04 - Sebastian Neubert
 - Protect timing histograms against log(dt=0) entries.
   If the line finishes quicker than the timing resolution of the system call (1mus)
   then the lowest bin of the histo is filled. task #44041

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p4 2013-06-13 =========================

! 2013-05-14 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a few icc11 warnings from Selection::Line, plus a little tidy up.

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p3 2013-05-07 =========================

! 2013-02-27 - Chris Jones
 - Fix -pedantic compilation warnings

!========================= SelectionLine v1r0p2 2012-11-30 =========================

! 2012-11-29 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

!======================= SelectionLine v1r0p1 2010-02-27 =====================

! 2010-02-27 - Gerhard Raven
 - shorten histogram names

!======================= SelectionLine v1r0 2010-01-29 =====================

! 2010-01-18 - Gerhard Raven
 - initial import of code adapted from Hlt/HltLine, together with 
   HltBase/HltHistogramUtilities (the latter is here for dependency reasons
   only, and should be moved 'further' down in the dependency stack)
 - reshuffle a bit.. (Line.{h,cpp} -> SelectionLine.{h,cpp}, move SelectionLine.h
   into Kernel)
