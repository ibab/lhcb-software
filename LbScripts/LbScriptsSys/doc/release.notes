	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py: added explicitly the gcc46 entries in the list of
	supported platforms.

	LbLegacy:
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: fixed the usage of getTarBallNameItems. Now
	only uses the internal one.

2011-11-21  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

	* cmt/requirements: release of version v6r6p1

	LbConfiguration:
	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py: removed the usage of
	NO_PYTHON_LIBPATH in the extratags. This was intended to removed
	the python entry from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH because the python that
	we ship is statically linked. Unfortunately not all the binary
	libraries have been statically linked with lipython2.6.so.
	* scripts/generateLogin: idem

2011-11-18  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

        * cmt/requirements: release of version v6r6

	LbConfiguration:
	* LbConfiguration/python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py: fixed
	the usage of LbConfiguration.Project.project_list.  The
	SetupProject module doesn't modify it anymore.
	* scripts/generateLogin: fixed the logging level after the call to
	LbLogin and SetupProject. LbLogin for sure was modifying the
	global level.
	* python/LbConfiguration/External.py: added the global distribution URL
	* python/LbConfiguration/Package.py: use the distribution URL in order to get SVN informations
	* python/LbConfiguration/Project.py: idem
	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py: added support for gcc46 for slc5 and slc6.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Package.py: added WG/RDConfig WG/CharmConfig to the list of supported
	"data" packages.
	* scripts/generateLogin: set CMTEXTRATAGS to NO_PYTHON_LIBPATH for the cache generation.
	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py:
	- factored out the CMTEXTRATAGS tweaking in a separate method.
	- added the NO_PYTHON_LIBPATH tag to the default CMTEXTRATAGS list passed to SetupProject.
	  This will prevent the setup of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for python. This is not needed since python
	  is linked statically to libpython.so. And this causes bad interferences with the system
	  python (/usr/bin/python26 which is not linked statically).
	- fixed usage of the "debug" argument that was not working after the introduction of the "-w" option.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Project.py:
	- added short cuts for volume names per project.
	- added AFSReleaseVolumeName function to get the name per version.

	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: fixed the checking of the Update.py script. Now it is done
	incrementally in all the components of MYSITEROOT.
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: fixed the logging level that is changed internally by LbLogin.
	restored it to its nominal value.
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: added protection to the getCached function to avoid looking for
	external projects.
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py: added try/except protection for getProject and getPackage to
	allow the use of a former LbConfiguration version with a different argument list.
	* python/LbLegacy/vol_for_releases.py: use the AFSReleaseVolumeName method to
	get the name of the volume.
	* scripts/mkMCGentar: removed the stripping of the "p" patch version for the GENSER
	tarball.

	LbRelease:
	* LbRelease/python/LbRelease/rcs.py: improved support for branches
	(in Subversion) (Marco Cl.)
	* LbRelease/scripts/svnpath: minor changes to adapt to latest rcs
	module (Marco Cl.)
	* LbRelease/scripts/tag_package: added support for tagging from branches,
	tagging of projects and implicit versions (from requirements)
	(Marco Cl.)
	* LbRelease/python/LbRelease/SvnChecker/StdCheckers.py: extended
	version format, allow 'gX' (Marco Cl.)

	LbUtils:
	* python/LbUtils/afs/volume.py:
	- added the isFull method to the volume class.
	- added remainingSpace method.
	- added relative option to remainingSpace and usedSpace methods.
	* python/LbUtils/afs/volume.py: factor out the maximal length for a volume name (22) into
	the MAX_NAME_LENGTH variable.


2011-10-19  Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch>

        * cmt/requirements: release of version v6r5p1

	LbConfiguration:
	* python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py:
	- forces the usage of the usage of the LCG python if a specific version
	  of python is requested.
	- python/LbConfiguration/LbLogin.py: added the "-w" option in order to do partial selection of the CMTCONFIG. For
	  example "LbLogin -w i686" will select the best i686 CMTCONFIG for the platform. The order of selection is
	  defined in LbConfiguration.Platform (EXPERIMENTAL).
	* python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py (Marco Cl.):
	- fixed bug #86875 Added the possibility to pretend we are on CVMFS via an environment
	  variable (SP_FAKE_CVMFS).
	- removed DIRAC/LHCbDIRAC hacks
	* python/LbConfiguration/Package.py:
	- added Det/STSQLDDDB in the list of supported packages.
	- added SVN fallback to getPackage.
	- added security check when retrieving packages from SVN. It checks that
	  the containing project is in the supported ones list.

	- added hook for post installation of LbScripts
	- wrapped os.system call to rather use the subprocess module when possible.
	- added environment passing to systemCall
	- added infrastructure in order to call an update script each time that that project
	  is listed in the dependencies.
	- implemented -t option to pass custom temporary base directory. It is then randomly seeded.
	  Please note that the safest is to used the canonical system one. ie: "-t $TMPDIR" or "-t /tmp"
	- added post install action for data packages. Now it also tries to look for PostInstall.py in <packgage>/<ver>/cmt
	- registered an "atexit" function in order to do a final removal of the temporary directory if mdtemp was used.
	- use the SVN fallback for the project configuration.
	- implement cache for project and package configuration. This
	  prevent too many useless connection to SVN if the package/project is not known. To be
	  noted that a proper abstraction of the configuration from both package and projects would
	  be better.
	- fixed the safeMove function that treats correctly links (at the first level) that are moved
	  across filesystems.
	- added safeMakeDirs that removes correctly broken links on the target directory.
	- replaced plain mkdirs with safeMakeDirs that first remove broken links if it exists.
	- factored out the md5 extraction to extractMD5SumFromFile
	- use the new getPackage version (with SVN fallback) instead of the plain package_names for the
	  datapackage identification.
	- generalised getMD5FileName. Now it also works with html files.
	* scripts/mkMCGentar: global fix for generator comming from a different location than the
	regular MCGenerators directory.
	* scripts/mkLCGCMTtar: converted binary type for gcc. This one exposes the host tag for its binary version
	and we need to use the target tag when building the tarballs.
	* scripts/mkLHCbtar: added calculation of the MD5 sum for the distribution.htm file.

	LbRelease:
	* Major clean up of Pydev Code Analysis warnings
	* python/LbRelease/GetPack.py: factored out utilities placed in LbUtils.VCS.

	* python/LbConfiguration/SetupProject.py: added debug printout for
	the stripping of PATHs (Marco Cl.)
	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py:

	this prevent the loading of the distributed python.
	- treat the case of ~/cmtuser being a valid or a broken link. If it is a valid link or a directory,
	then it goes unmolested. If it is a broken link or a file, it is renamed with the "_bak" extension
	and a directory is created.


	LbLegacy
	* python/LbLegacy/install_project.py:
	- implemented function to fix the $CMTROOT/mgr/setup.{sh,csh}. In these files the CMTROOT
	is always reset. Now they doesn't try to set it if it is already present in the environment.

	- fixed problem with generateLogin if the MYSITEROOT directory has somewhere a link in its path.
	- fixed the comparison of the lhcb subdirectory with os.getcwd() by using os.path.abspath. Because
	this is what os.getcwd() is returning anyway.
	- added clone of cleanPath (LbUtils.Path) in order to clean up the initial MYSITEROOT and VO_LHCB_SW_DIR.
	Please note that the path is not normalized (os.path.normpath) because it could lead to inconsistencies
	if there are ".." and links.
	- fixed unTarFile function. Now an output_path parameter can be passed to the function.
	- fixed removal of the .html file in overwrite mode.
	- fixed copy of existing install_project.py into .old. This was breaking when installing
	remotely (not in the current directory) and when a self update was performed.
	- added checks for VO_LHCB_SW_DIR. If MYSITEROOT has only one entry, an attempt is made to correct
	the value of that variable. It will succeed only if $MYSTEROOT==$VO_LHCB_SW_DIR/lib.
	- added the version of LbScripts in the banner in debug mode.
	* scripts/mkLHCbtar:
	- fixed osc_vis dependency extraction. Removed obsolete CVS update for the Gaudi project.
	- fixed usage of the TempDir class.
	* scripts/mkproject:
	- moved the fixLinks function. Now it only applies when locking (-a K) or when creating tarballs.

	* scripts/mkLCGCMTtar: fixed typo when calling the CMT

	LbRelease:
	* python/LbRelease/CMT/LbProject.py:
	fixed usage of the User release area in LbCMTWhich.

	The version is the one of the project if it is a regular project and it is the one of
	the package for versionless projects like DBASE.
	syntax: lbwhich Project Package version
	       lbwhich Project version
               lbwhich Project Package
               lbwhich Project

	* python/LbRelease/LHCbNightliesWebpage.py: disabled project shown in grey; configuration
	for summary generation taken from svn.cern.ch (https) instead of svnweb (http); project
	list sorted in the "Display criteria"; link to SVN modified to point to configuration
	file (Karol)

	  works for any version type (LHCb, LCG, ROOT) except for the extended LHCb version with the "-pre" suffix.
	* python/LbConfiguration/Platform.py: added support for win64 and vc9.
	* scripts/generateLogin: fixed the test for the login shell in the main wrapper.

	  LbUtils.Processes module.
	* python/LbRelease/LHCbNightlies.py: client must be started with CMTCONFIG as a parameter,
	  and now it can build only platforms that have not only the same platform type (slc4/sl5)
	  but also matching architecture (32b/64b) (already in production) (Karol)

	* data/Makefile: removed the export of CCACHE_PREFIX, which doesn't seem to be needed and causes problems
