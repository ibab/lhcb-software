Package: GaudiOnline
Author:  Markus Frank

! 2015-09-30 - Giacomo Graziani
- add a LazyRunable doing nothing for tasks which just need to wait and don't expect input events

 - Minor fix to CMake configuration.

! 2014-01-21 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed problem in requirements to use the new GaudiPluginService:
    replaced generate_rootmap with generate_componentslist

! 2014-01-07 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMakeLists.txt.

! 2013-07-31 - Marco Clemencic
 - Removed obsolete file.

! 2009-12-02 Albert Puig
 - Removed sliceID info from DimRPCFileReader and DimRPCFileReaderCommand.

! 2009-11-12 Markus Frank
 - Add timeout algorithm. This algorithm may be used to trigger processing timeouts.
   In the event a timeout occurs, the event processing thread throws an out-of-context
   C++ exception, which should stop the current algorithm to process events.
 - Add mechanism to handle exceptions such as segment violations (SIGSEGV) in the
   MEP framework of the HLT. In case Moore has an access violation, the Moore task
   flags the event as bad. The Holder service then scans the event descriptor(s)
   and may save the events contained in this mulkti event structure. All events
   in the MEP are saved, not only the event causing the problem.
   Further investigations must then happen offline.

! 2009-03-11 Markus Frank
 - GaudiTask.cpp Reconnect to incident service in start() if disconnected during stop()

   (Exception "Bad magic pattern" and "Unknown Bank")

! 2008-04-10 Markus Frank, A.Navarro
 - Fix finalization bug in EventRunable.
 - New class DimRPCFileReader

! 2008-03-10 Markus Frank

   If the MEPManager.PartitionName is not set partitioning (if requested) will
   be done by partition ID.

 - Add algorithm, which allows to merge Events from TES to output buffer:
   src/RawEvent2MBMMergerAlg.cpp

   implementation

! 2007-07-09 Sai Suman
 - Added an additional socket for sending MEP Requests.

   and added a protocol number to open_sock().
 - Added job options InitialMEPRQs and MEPsPerMEPRQ to MEPRxSvc.

! 2007-06-10 Markus Frank
 - Fix locking mechanism in the SocketSender and SocketReceiver class;
   Check if while processing a network request, a possible
   call to finalize() is queued in the application manager.
 - Fix some typos in the joboptions.

! 2007-05-30 Markus Frank
 - Add SocketSender and SocketReceiver class for data transfer based on the
   net library OnlineKernel/NET/DataTransfer.
   Note: DIM monitoring does not work properly if the data network is not
   accessible from the controls network and data are transferred using DIM.
   For such cases use OnlineKernel/NET/DataTransfer.

! 2007-05-10 Markus Frank
 - Fix bug to NOT free event on cancel.
 - Fix bug in DIM command handling to set state to error if initialization fails.

!================== GaudiOnline v2r7 2007-04-12 ==========================
! 2007-04-24 Eric van Herwijnen
 - Fix to main.cpp for failing dynamic_cast in shared libraries

 - Added classes for network data transfer between HLT farm ans storage layer.
   Concrete implementations go along using AMS and DIM.

! 2006-12-17 Domenico Galli
 - Added FmcMessageSvc, an implementation of the Gaudi MessageSvc class,
   which streams messages from Gaudi to the FMC logger. This service
   for the time being can only be activated in linux.
   The corresponding small test is located in tests/cmt/fmc.csh

!================== GaudiOnline v2r5 2006-12-?? ==========================
! 2006-12-07 Markus Frank

   based on a request answer scheme. Goes along with tests/cmt/mfarm.bat
   as a test.
 - Concrete subclass of network agent using AMS
 - Concrete subclass of network agent using DIM
 - Allow to suspend the OnlineEvtSelector with the interface ISuspendable
   using unnamed locks.
 - Added simple MDF injector into buffer manager for testing purpose

!================== GaudiOnline v2r3 2006-11-27 ==========================
! 2006-11-27 Markus Frank
 - First version of buffer manager monitor service using the
   IMonitorSvc interface. This will trigger change
   in IMonitorSvc interface to include also device based
   quantities - not only scalars.

! 2006-11-20 Markus Frank
 - Remove test scripts from top level cmt area.
   Romove all unnecessary dependencies.
 - Create seperate tests area with cmt directory.
   Sub package carries all dependencies to execute tests.
 - Add basic online monitoring quantities to several services

! 2006-10-20 Markus Frank
 - Adjust to MDF as in EDMS note.
 - Publich FSM substate for DIM tasks for debugging purposes.

! 2006-10-02 Markus Frank
 - Modify MEPHolderSvc to directly scan the MBM tables to release events
   rather waiting until the reference count is NULL before releasing event.
 - Add options for Slow/Normal and Fast Spy tasks (SpyMBMxxx.opts)
 - Add delay algorithm sleeping for a configurable number of milli seconds.

!================== GaudiOnline v2r2 2006-09-06 ==========================

! 2005-07-22 - Gaidioz Benjamin

   HLT event number. Now set to zero

! 2005-07-14 - Marco Cattaneo

! 2005-06-22 - Benjamin Gaidioz
  Adapt to change in SFC client library

! 2005-06-12 - Markus Frank
  Fill first guess into L1 decision block according to information from
  T.Schietinger

! 11-06-2005 Markus Frank
  Fix compiler warnings (unused vars & deprecated) in DimMessageSvc.

!================== GaudiOnline v1r0 2005-05-13 =============================
! 10-05-2005 Markus Frank
  Adapt to LHCb v18r4 and the use of RawEvent/L1Event instead of
  RawBuffer and L1Buffer

 There are a few examples coming along with this package.
 1) options/RawBufferWriter: Write binary raw buffer file from POOL dst
 2) options/RawBufferSender: Send RawBuffer object using IP connection
    to analysis process
 3) options/RawBufferReader: Reads RawBuffer objects from process
    RawBufferSender (which must be started before). Skeleton analysis process.
    Note: Examples need environment SFCCONNECTION to be set properly.

  New Package.
