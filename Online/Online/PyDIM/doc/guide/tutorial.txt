This tutorial explains how to create `DIM`_ servers and clients with PyDIM. It 
also includes an overview of some DIM concepts, however is recommend to 
read the `DIM documentation`_.

.. note::
    This tutorial is far from complete. For the time being is just a 
    collection of examples, although they include the instructions as code
    comments. Consider this document as a work in progress. 



Using DIM services
==================

DIM services are values provided by the servers to the clients. Normally, these
values are read by the client when the connection begins and then they are
updated when they change or at certain time intervals, accordingly to the 
configuration of the client.

This example shows how to create a server with two services.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/services-server.py

The client
----------

The following example shows a client for the example server:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/services-client.py

DIM commands
============

DIM commands are services that receive arguments from the client but they do 
not return a value. They can be used for running a specific code routine in the
server.

Server
------

The following example shows a DIM server with commands:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/commands-server.py

Client
------

This is the code for calling the commands from the server:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/commands-client.py
