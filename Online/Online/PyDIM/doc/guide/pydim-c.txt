=====================================
:mod:`pydim` - Interface to DIM C API 
=====================================

.. module:: pydim

The :mod:`pydim` module  is basically a wrapper for the DIM C API. It's very
close to the `DIM C API`_ so it should be straightforward to use for people
with previous experience in DIM. Also a new interface, more *pythonic* is under
development that should be easy to use for newcomers.  

For further reference, please consult the `documentation for the DIM C 
API <http://dim.web.cern.ch/dim/dimC.html>`_.


Description string
==================

The description is a string that specifies the number, the order and the type 
of data published by services or required by the commands. This  string can be 
seen as the *signature* of the services and commands and thus is required by 
DIM clients and servers.

The contents of the service can be described in the form::

  "T:N;T:N;T" 

where T is the data type and N is the number of items of that type.

The available types are the following: 

 - C(har)
 - I(nt)
 - L(ong)
 - S(hort)
 - D(ouble)
 - F(loat)
 - X(tra long) and

A data type alone at the end of string means all following items are of type T. 
   
For example, the string `I:1;D:1;` can be used for a service that publishes 1 
integer (`I`) and 1 double (`D`). A command that accepts 2 arguments: an 
integer and an string of characters of variable length can use the string 
`I:1;C`. Note that an element of variable length can be specified only at the 
end of the string.

Note that when **sending strings** as command arguments, they must be \\0
terminated. This is necessary because DIM does not distinguish between a 
string of characters and a byte array. In both cases the type used in the
service description is ` C`. Additionally, the interface to the DIM C API 
doesn not automatically add the `\0` at the end of the string, and this must
be made **manually** by the client application.

Server functions
================

This modules provides access to the main functions for creating DIM servers
and publishing services and commands.

.. function:: dis_add_service(name, description, callback, tag)

   Registers a new service with the DNS server.

   Arguments are:
   
   *name* The name of the service. It must be a unique name within a DNS server.

   *description* `Description string`_ of the service.

   *callback* A callback function that will be executed for getting the value
   of the service.

   *tag*  A parameter to be sent to the callback in order to identify the 
   service. Normally this parameter is rarely used (but it's still
   mandatory, though).

   This function returns a *serviceid*, a value that can be used for referring
   to the service.  This can be used for updating its value or getting
   information about it.


.. function:: dis_update_service(serviceid, [values])

   Report the change of service contents to interested clients.

   Arguments are:

   *serviceid* An identifier of the service.

   *values* (optional) A tuple with the new values of the service.

   The behaviour of this function will vary depending if the ``values`` argument
   is passed or not.

   When the function is called *without* the ``values`` argument the callback
   function that was registered with the service  will be executed and its
   return value will be sent to the clients.  

   When `dis_update_service` is called *with* the ``value`` argument, this is
   sent directly to the clients as the service value, *without* executing the
   callback function. Please note that the argument must be a tuple, and the
   number and the type of the arguments must correspond to the service
   description. 

   For example, if the service returns two integer values (e.g. ``"I:1,I:1"``)
   the tuple must contain two integer, like this:

   >>> pydim.dis_update_service(serviceid, (42, 81))

   Even if the service returns *only one* value, the argument must be a tuple
   of one element:

   >>> pydim.dis_update_service(serviceid, (42,))

.. function:: dis_add_cmnd(name, description, callback, tag)
    
   Add a command service to the DIM server.

   Arguments are:

   *name* The name of the command. As with the name of the services, commands
   names must be unique.

   *description* `Description string`_ of the commands defining the arguments 
   that will be send to the command.

   *callback* A function be executed when a command request is received from a
   client. The number and the type of the function arguments must correspond 
   with the command description string. Note that the function will be called
   with as many arguments as values are specified in the description string
   (not with a tuple that contains all the arguments).

   *tag* A parameter to be sent to the callback in order to identify the 
   command.

.. function:: dis_start_serving(name)

   Start handling client requests.

   Arguments are:

   *name* The name of the server.

   This function must be called on every DIM server, otherwise the services and
   commands will not be available for the clients.

.. function:: dis_stop_serving()

   Stops the DIM server.

.. function:: dis_get_dns_node()

   Returns the DNS node
   
.. function:: dis_get_dns_port()

   Returns the DNS port.

.. function:: dis_set_dns_node(node)

   Arguments are:

   *node* A string with the host name or address of the DNS node.

   Sets the value of the DNS node.

.. function:: dis_set_dns_port(port)

   Arguments are:

   *port* An integer with the port of the DNS node.

   Sets the value of the DNS port.

Client functions
================

The :mod:`pydim` module also provides the necessary functions for creating DIM 
clients that can get information from services and execute commands in the 
server. 

The client functions supports both *asynchronous* and *synchronous* 
communication. Usually, the former is preferred for DIM client, in this case 
it's  necessary to specify a callback function that will be executed when the
data is received.  

However, sometimes it's necessary to use synchronous communication. In this
client the execution of a function will block the program until a response
from the server is received. For example, this can be the desired behavior 
in a shell script. 

A note on strings
-----------------


Asynchronous functions
----------------------

.. function:: dic_cmnd_service(name, arguments, description)

   Request the execution of a command.

   Arguments are:

   *name* Command name, same name used by server when declaring the command
   service. 

   *arguments* A tuple with the values that are sent to the command as 
   arguments.

   *description* `Description string`_ of the command.

   This function allows clients (e.g. user interfaces) to send commands to
   be executed by the servers.

   This function requests the execution of a command by a server. This implies
   contacting the name server (if the command in not know already) and then
   contacting directly the server. 
    
   This function does not report back the completion of the command since 
   these operations are only scheduled and may complete *asynchronously*.

   If the server is not responding the command is discarded (in order 
   to avoid having it sent later when it might not be desired anymore).


.. function:: dic_cmnd_callback(name, arguments, description, callback, tag)

   Request the execution of a command and registers a completion callback.

   Arguments are:

   *name* Command name, same name used by server when declaring the command
   service. 

   *arguments* A tuple with the values that are sent to the command as 
   arguments.

   *description* `Description string`_ of the command.

   *callback*  A Python callable object (e.g. a function) that will be called 
   when the command completes. The function is called with 2 arguments:  
   `tag` and `ret_code`. `tag` is the value passed to this function and 
   `retcode` is an integer which indicates if the command was executed 
   successfully; 1 if it was correctly sent to the server, 0 otherwise.   
   
   *tag* A parameter in order to identify the command.

   This function works in the same way as `dic_cmnd_service`, but it allows to
   use a callback function to identify the command that has completed.
 

.. function:: dic_info_service(name, description, callback, service_type=pydim.MONITORED, timeout=0, tag=0, default_value=None)

   Request an information service from a server.

   Arguments are:

   *name* Service name. same name used by server when declaring the service.

   *description* `Description string`_ of the service.

   *callback* A function that will be called when the service updates its
   value. The number and the type of the function arguments must correspond 
   with the service description string. Note that the function will be called
   with as many arguments as values are specified in the service description
   string (not with a tuple that contains all the arguments).

   *service_type*  Type of service, constants defined are: :data:`ONCE_ONLY`,
   :data:`TIMED` or :data:`MONITORED`. Default value is :data:`MONITORED`. 
   See the definition of the constants below.

   *timeout* For a TIMED or MONITORED service "timeout" indicates the time 
   interval the server should use to send new data, for ONCE_ONLY  services it
   indicates the time after which the service is considered to have failed.
   Default value is ``0``. 

   *tag* A value that is passed to the internal C DIM callback. It cannot be
   accessed within the Python code.

   *default_value* The value that will be passed to the callback function in 
   case the service doesn't succeed.
   
   Returns an integer used as service identification id.

.. autofunction:: pydim.dic_sync_info_service
.. autofunction:: pydim.dic_sync_cmnd_service
 

Utility functions
-----------------

.. function:: dic_get_dns_node()

   Returns the DNS node
   
.. function:: dic_get_dns_port()

   Returns the DNS port.

.. function:: dic_set_dns_node(node)

.. function:: dic_release_service(service_id)

   Called by a client when a service is not needed anymore.

   Arguments are:
   
   *service_id* Service identification id.
   
   This function tells the server not to update this service anymore and 
   destroys all the references to it in the client.
   
.. function:: dic_get_conn_id()

   Returns the connection id of a DIM server. Its purpose is to obtain the
   identifier that is required by other functions.
   
.. function:: dic_get_server_services(conn_id)

   Arguments are:
   
   *conn_id* of a DIM server as obtained by `dim_dic_get_conn_id`
   
   Returns a list of services of the specified server, to which this client 
   has subscribed.

.. function:: dic_add_error_handler(callback)

   Adds an error handler to this client.
   
   Arguments are:
    
   *callback* A Python callable object (e.g. a function) that will be 
   called whenever an error occurs in the DIM client. The function is called 
   with 3 arguments:  severity, error_code, message. 


Constants
=========

.. data:: ONCE_ONLY

   The client will receive the data once and disconnect from the server.

.. data:: TIMED

   The client will receive the data at regular intervals, specified by the
   parameter timeout. In principle to be used with servers that do not
   explicitly update the service (using ``pydim.dis_update_service``).

.. data:: MONITORED
   
   The client will receive the data when the server updates it (by calling
   dis_update_service()), but also at regular intervals if the "timeout"
   parameter is different from 0. The "timeout" parameter can be set to 0 to
   receive data only on server update.
