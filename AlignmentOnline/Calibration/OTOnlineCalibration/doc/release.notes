- threshold to update the t0 set to 0.1. Missing message: change in the global 
t0 precision, done in June

! 2015-06-22 - Lucia Grillo
- writeXML routine adapted to have a boost::filesystem::path XML_path as
  argument.
- std::setprecision(4) when writing the global t0 to the xml file.
- Added histogram for monitoring (histogram fitted in the calibration).
  the histogram is saved in a root file in /hist/Savesets/2015/LHCb/
  OTOnlineClbr/MM/DD/OTOnlineClbr-run#-...root
  if SaveFits = True (creates the path if it doesn't exist)

! 2015-05-26 - Roel AAij
 - Reading T0 from data works.
 - Calibration works as intended with FEST.
 - Created startup scripts for both LHCb and FEST.
 - Use LHCb clock phase only when checking if difference is above max,
   not for above threshold.

! 2015-04-15 - Roel Aaij
 - Fix race condition between start and analyse.
 - Listen to DIM service that exports LHCb clock phase.
 - Add option to switch on/off usage of LHCb clock phase.
 - Read T0 used in data from XML used by online Brunel.
 - Don't redo calibration if calibration we before created is not yet used.
 - Judgement to write new XML is done on (prevPhase + dataT0) - (phase + t0).
 - Final testing to be done.

! 2015-04-13 - Roel Aaij
 - Large update to calibration algorithm.
   - Anything that is not global T0 calibration has been removed.
   - Algorithm tested with FEST.
   - Correct XML is written.
   - Publish version in format expected by Clara.

! 2015-03-04 - Roel Aaij
 - Updates and fixes to run online. Configuration script and test script
   to launch additional log viewer.

! 2015-02-03 Lucia Grillo
 - added boost v* in the requirements.
 - when a new global t0 has to be written a folder v(n_existing+1) is created
   and inside a structure as in the db is created:
   /Conditions/OT/Calibration/CalibrationGlobal.xml

! 2015-02-02 Lucia Grillo
 - getting the drift time residual distribution for each station from the EOR
   files (monitoring from Brunel: OTTrackMonitor)
 - variable double globalt0_threshold default value = 0.1 (ns), otherwise
   to be specified. If |global_t0| > globalt0_threshold => xml file with the new
   condition is writte.

! 2015-01-30 Lucia Grillo
 - Flag to do only global t0 calibration; global t0 wrote in the xml format
   designed by Wouter
 - Default only global t0 calibration
   reads global t0 from Wouter's database and writes xml file in the same format
 - Added histog_2d_109.root and clbr_hists_109.root, examples input files with
   monolayer alignment used. Note that at the moment the input global t0 histo is
   actually the sum of the histos of the 3 stations. I will change this using an
   example of monitoring .root file to give the right format.

! 2015-01-29 Lucia Grillo
 - Version used for studies: 2d histo with FitSlicesY();
   Lots of output: txt file for the offsets, all fits saved in rootfile,
   global t0 calculated and module t0 calculated.
   Still to work on the format of the output xmls

! 2015-01-22 Lucia Grillo
 - Different calculations of t0 per Module (4 contribution or single
   contribution, fits or get mean); Added the global t0 computation.
   xml format to be finalized; "Monitoring" histograms: replaced the old ones
   with a simpler version. to be improved.
 - Fix to the Save_Fits option; correction for m==8 (only 2 halfs monolayers)

! 2015-01-12 - Lucia Grillo
 - Adding OTt0OnlineClbr for online calibration of t0
 - First version: compiling, stil to be tested

! 2015-01-12 - Roel Aaij
 - initial import
 - Add dependency on OMAlib
