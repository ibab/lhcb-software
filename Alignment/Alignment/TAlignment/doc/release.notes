</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r0>2007-04-25 TAlignment v3r0</A></H1><PRE>
- 2007-04-25 - Johan Blouw
 - moved tool parts to AlignTrTools
 - moved interface to AlignmentInterfaces
 Contains now 3 algorithms:
  - AlignAlgorithm: Generic chi^2 minimisation algorithm
  - GAlign: performs alignment using Millepede for TT,OT & IT
  - TStation: algorithm to select tracks and store them in a dst
