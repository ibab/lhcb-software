Package : AlignmentTools
Package Coordinator : Sebastien Viret
Purpose : provides a c++ translation of Volker Blobel's Millepede algorithm.

! 2014-01-10 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration.

!========================= AlignmentTools v3r0p1 2012-03-28 =========================
! 2012-03-07 Wouter Hulsbergen
 - resolve gcc4.6 compilor warnings

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r1>2010-05-02 AlignmentTools v3r1</A></H1><PRE>
 - tagged this package as v3r1 for alignment release v4r6


! 2009-12-27 Johan Blouw
 - removed unnecessary variables from Centipede.

! 2009-12-27 Johan Blouw
 - small changes to Centipede, to accomodate M. Deissenroth's implementation
   of millepede alignment of OT.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v3r0>2009-02-21 AlignmentTools v3r0</A></H1><PRE>

- J. Blouw: removed linker libarary on account of pythonization of Escher
- introduced new tag v3r0

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r11>2008-12-09 AlignmentTools v2r11</A></H1><PRE>

- J. Blouw: new tag for release v3r2 of alignment project software


! 2008-07-17 - Louis Nicolas
 - Commented unused variables in methods of Centipede

- 24/05/08 J. Blouw: modification of 04/02/08 introduced a small bug, a bit
  further in that method (MakeGlobalFit). If psigm < 0, then the C-matrix is
  not inverted. It has been changed to "if ( fabs( psigm[i]) > 0.0 ) {".

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r10>2008-15-05 AlignmentTools v2r10</A></H1><PRE>
- J. Blouw: tiny compilation problem with Centipede class solved

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r9>2008-15-05 AlignmentTools v2r9</A></H1><PRE>
- J.Blouw: create new tag, because of small changes listed below.

- 04/02/08 - Johan Blouw: small change to Millepede class, 
                          in MakeGlobalFit. There, in an if statement
             it is checked whether "psigm[i] <= 0.0". This was changed to
             "psigm[i] == 0" so that the complete if block can be ignored when
             psigm < 0, if so desired

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-09-03 AlignmentTools v2r8</A></H1><PRE>
- 16/10/2007 - Johan Blouw ** v2r8 **
  -> small changes to Centipede class to avoid compilation problems on windows OS.
     NOTE: this change has been incorporated under the same tag!!!!

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-09-03 AlignmentTools v2r8</A></H1><PRE>
- 03/09/2007 - JOhan Blouw ** v2r8 **
  -> samll change in Centipede class such that it's methods are only called with vectors.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-08-28 AlignmentTools v2r7p1</A></H1><PRE>
- 28/08/2007 - Seb Viret ** v2r7p1 **
  -> Small change of the InitMille() method in Millepede (back to v2r5 version). Centipede is still using the InitMille method it needs (with nglo = the total number of degrees of freedom).

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-08-28 AlignmentTools v2r7</A></H1><PRE>
- 28/08/2007 - Johan Blouw ** v2r7 **
  -> added Centipede class, which acts as a tool to hide the different use of
     Millepede by the Heidelberg group. That is, Centipede inherits from Millepede and
     overloads/replaces certain methods in the Millepede class.
  -> small change to Millepede.h: variables in the class are now 'protected' instead of  
     'private', so that the Centipede class can use them.
 
</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r6>2007-05-14 AlignmentTools v2r6</A></H1><PRE>
- 15/05/2007 - Johan Blouw     ** v2r6 **
  -> removed *_load.cpp since it is not needed anymore

- 14/05/2007 - Johan Blouw     ** v2r6 **
  -> release for the software project
     - moved some info statements to debug statements

- 08/05/2007 - Johan Blouw     same version
  -> Made Millepede tool compliant to new way of declaring tools
     Small changes to print a bit more output

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r5>2007-04-15 AlignmentTools v2r5</A></H1><PRE>
- 25/04/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r5 **

  -> Correction of a memory allocation problem. It only affects the method InitMille()
     which now has to have the number of fits as last argument in input. This number is 
     then used to resize the vectors that will contains the infos for iterations: storeare,
     storeind,... 

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r4>2007-03-07 AlignmentTools v2r4</A></H1><PRE>
- 07/03/2007 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r4 **

  -> Final modifications of the code in order to handle non-linear derivatives. The process
     is now generalized, and handled by 2 arrays: dernl (contains the global derivative
     related to a non-linear term) and dernl_i (contains the reference to the corresponding 
     non-linear term, ie the local parameter number). This new way of doing is illustrated in 
     a simple example available at the following address:

     http://ppewww.physics.gla.ac.uk/LHCb/VeloAlign/StandaloneCode.html

  -> Minor bug fixes in EquLoc method.

  -> The package has been tested on both slc3 and slc4 with Brunel v30r14
 

- 06/02/2007 - Johan Blouw  ** v2r4 **

  -> Added "#include math.h" in order to be able to compile & link on slc4

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r3>2006-12-13 AlignmentTools v2r3</A></H1><PRE>
- 13/12/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r3 **

  -> Memory allocation problems have been fixed, code speed has been optimized a little bit,
     in particular in FitLoc and Spavat methods (callgrind job showed that 75% of the time was spent
     in Spavat...)

  -> Options file has been removed (options should be set during the alignment process 
     (see VeloAlignment/v*/opts/VeloAlign.opts for an example)

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r2>2006-07-27 AlignmentTools v2r2</A></H1><PRE>
- 27/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r2 **

  -> Modification done for ACDC2 alignment. Option FirstFixed has been replaced by ModuleFixed. 
     It means that every module could now be fixed, just have to give its number in the otpions 
     file

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r3>2006-07-26 AlignmentTools v2r1</A></H1><PRE>
- 26/07/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r1 **

  -> Small modification of version v2r0, fitglo() adapted to non-linear derivatives. A new option
     has also been added, which enable to fix the first element to align. This option could be used 
     when constraint equations are not appropriate (low number of elements).

     For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package (version v2r0 and higher).

     This release is also adapted to DC06 reconstruction software (LHCb v20r* and higher).

     Package has been tested with : LHCb   v21r2
                                    Brunel v30r5

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v2r0>2006-01-18 AlignmentTools v2r0</A></H1><PRE>

- 18/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v2r0 **
  -> All informations specific to the have been suppressed from the package. This 
     one is now completely independant.

     For an example of how to use it, see the VeloAlignment package.

     Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                       Brunel v28r2

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v1r0>2006-01-16 AlignmentTools v1r0</A></H1><PRE>

- 16/01/2006 - Sebastien Viret  ** v1r0 **
  -> First release of the AlignmentTools package.

     Environment requested to compile: LHCb   v19r3
                                       Brunel v28r2
     Tools included:
          Millepede  - Millepede C++ translation 


  -> This package is intended to provide an interface to Millepede usable by the different 
     sub-detectors for their own alignment algorithm.
